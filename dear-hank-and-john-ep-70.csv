0,0:00:00,0:00:23,SPEAKER 1," Hello and welcome to Dear Hank and John. It's a comedy podcast about death where myself  John Green and usually my brother Hank Green, although not this week because he is on paternity  leave, answer your questions, provide you dubious advice and bring you all the weeks news  from both Mars and AFC Wimbledon. This week, I am so thrilled to be joined by Ashley Ford.  Hi, Ashley. "
1,0:00:23,0:00:26,SPEAKER 2," Hi, John. I'm so glad to be here. "
2,0:00:26,0:00:34,SPEAKER 1," So tell us a little bit about yourself. Right, I like to put the self promo right at the beginning,  so 100% of listeners hear it. "
3,0:00:34,0:01:10,SPEAKER 2," Okay, my name is Ashley Ford. Obviously, I'm a writer and an editor and I do those things,  sort of like freelance or as some people want to be more fancy, call it self-employed.  Then during the day, I'm a development executive at a company called Matter Studios and I work  in web series and documentaries for them. I'm working on a book. I write stuff on the internet  all the time and I'm just like pretty much around, like I'm just around. "
4,0:01:10,0:01:23,SPEAKER 1," Actually, I think one of the best follows that you can possibly have on the website Twitter,  but also I'm a huge fan of your essays both memory and otherwise and very excited for your book. "
5,0:01:23,0:01:28,SPEAKER 2," Thanks, John. I'm excited about it too. We just got to do the thing, finish the thing. "
6,0:01:28,0:02:07,SPEAKER 1," I'm familiar with that very problem.  I'm living with it right now.  So Ashley, we've got to start the pod by answering the question that we received overwhelmingly  over the last few days, which is one version or another of what? Oh God! Panic!  What? How? What do we do? How do I move forward from people who are concerned about the results  of the U.S. election? And I don't know what to tell them. "
7,0:02:08,0:03:34,SPEAKER 2," You know, it's really tough. I don't necessarily know what to tell people right now,  which has been strange for me because I am that friend. People usually have who they call and  they say, I don't know how to feel and I don't know what to do. And I can offer reassurances.  And it was harder this time. It was so much harder. I had a really hard time reassuring myself.  I'm still not, I would say, properly reassured the way I want to be. But, you know, I think  at the end of the day, the thing that helps me sleep and the thing that helps me get out of bed  when I wake up is the idea that I'm one person, but I'm one person with some privilege and some power  and some say. And I did what I was supposed to do. I showed up at the polls and I cast my vote  and my person didn't win, but I don't think that that's the last vote I get to cast, you know?  And I think I actually cast votes every day with my choices, with my money, with the things  that I share on social media. I feel like now more than ever, I just need to be conscious  of how many votes I'm casting and in what direction I'm like, you know, hopefully influencing "
8,0:03:34,0:04:21,SPEAKER 1," the country in one way or another. That was so beautiful. I have literally nothing to add to it,  except to read a tweet that you wrote a couple days ago that I found very useful. You wrote,  I'm feeling a lot of things, not all bad, not all good, kind of scared and definitely nervous.  Mostly I'm committed to caring for myself. And the only thing I want to add to that is that,  you know, people need to take care of themselves and, you know, take care of yourself and remember,  like Ashley said, that every action that you take is casting a vote. That's very beautifully  put. I have nothing to add. Thanks John. Do you want to permanently replace Hank? He wouldn't "
9,0:04:21,0:04:32,SPEAKER 2," have been nearly as good in that one. Oh no, no, because I love listening to the pot. And I love  you guys's banter. And, you know, Hank has such a particular way of talking. It is so fast. "
10,0:04:32,0:04:38,SPEAKER 1," And it is so like, and he talks so fast that you think that he's smart. "
11,0:04:38,0:05:04,SPEAKER 2," You know what? If that's what he's doing, it's working. Okay? Because I'm usually like things happen  in the world. And I'm just like, you know, I'm really interested in how Hank is going to respond  to this because I know he's going to say smart things. And now I'm really questioning whether  not he's saying smart things. Or if I'm just like, sound smart, I'm in. Right. I think he might be "
12,0:05:04,0:05:55,SPEAKER 1," speaking very fast. And it's easy to mistake that. It's easy to mistake that for intelligence.  All right. I want to ask you some questions from our listeners. And maybe you can ask me some as  well since I know you have access to the magical Google doc. But I thought we could start with this  one. It comes from Caroline. But I'm pretty sure it doesn't actually come from Caroline. Ashley,  she writes, dear John and Hank, I want to start off by saying that I love your podcast. Thank you.  The reason I'm writing to you is because I just lost my class election for the senior class  secretarial position. I'm feeling very sad about the loss. And even though it was a close race,  I still feel as though my classmates do not like me enough to elect me to such a position.  What do you guys suggest in order to cope with this loss? And how do I still try to maintain a  position to make my senior year fun for my class? Now Ashley, I think we both know that Hillary Clinton "
13,0:05:55,0:06:11,SPEAKER 2," wrote this email. No, I think she did. I think she did. And pick Caroline of all names. And I'm  like as someone who went to North Carolina to talk to college students about, I'm a highly suspect "
14,0:06:11,0:06:36,SPEAKER 1," right now. I am so so suspicious. It's very suspicious. Oh, I called a lot of voters in North  Carolina in the five days before the election. Yeah, it was fascinating to talk to them. I did  greatly enjoy my many conversations with undecided voters in the days getting up to the election.  So yeah, I don't know. What do you say to somebody who is lost an election that's very important "
15,0:06:36,0:08:14,SPEAKER 2," to them? You know, I think that the beauty of elections, if there is a beauty, is that you really  have to like be committed to this idea that you might lose. You know, like there's this thing,  you know, like the beauty of it isn't the in the winning necessarily, but it is in the fact that  people have a choice. Like that's the beauty of an election is, you know, the choice and knowing  that people get to have that choice. And it doesn't mean it doesn't hurt. And it doesn't mean that  it doesn't smart a little bit. But I think, you know, I'm a realist who airs on the side of optimism  as a choice, you know. And what I found that has been true in my life is that anytime I didn't get  the thing I wanted, something better eventually came along for me that I would not have been  able to take part in had I gotten the thing that I thought I wanted. And it ended up being better  for me in the long run. And I'm not saying that that's true for everyone. And I'm not saying that  that's how it's always going to go. But I think there's a chance. And I think there's a lot to be  learned from our losses as well as our wins. And I think sometimes the lesson isn't just hours.  I think sometimes a person loses and the people who learn from that situation are the people  who either didn't choose that person or the people who didn't choose at all. That's again very "
16,0:08:14,0:09:22,SPEAKER 1," good advice. The only thing that I would add to that in my life, I've definitely found that I  learned more from failures and losses than I learned from successes. But it often takes me a while  before I understand what I've learned. Like in the moment, it can be very painful. But then  looking back on it later, I'm grateful for that experience. But I don't know how much it matters  to me in the moment that later I'll be grateful. Like I remember after I had this horrible breakup  just after the terrorist attacks on 9-11. And this woman and I had been living together. And we  thought we were going to get married and then we broke up. And it was very, very difficult for  me. And I went through a really hard time. And I remember my mother saying to me, one day you will  look back on this as one of the greatest things that ever happened to you. And I was like, well maybe  but not today. And I'm in today. Like I'm stuck in today and today sucks.  So it does suck. And I'm sorry. But I also do think that there will be lessons to be taken "
17,0:09:22,0:12:10,SPEAKER 2," from it. And you'll grow from it, Caroline. Absolutely. You absolutely will. And I had a similar  situation where I had a really bad breakup in college with someone who we were looking at apartments  together. And we were so in love. And we had never even been in a fight and all of these things.  And we got into one argument. And over the phone, he said, I just don't want to be a boyfriend anymore.  And it was terrible. And it threw me, you know, there are a lot of things going on in my life at  that point. But you know, that one situation just threw me into this really terrible depression. And  it was the worst of my life. And you know, that was about seven years ago. And I have not since then  felt anything that die or felt anything that bad until last week. And it was suddenly in last  week that I was like, that was the first time I've ever felt truly grateful for that bout of  terrible depression from 2009 was last week because suddenly I was looking at this depression that  felt, you know, or this feeling that felt insurmountable. And but it was so similar to that thing that  I had gotten over before that I was able to be like, oh no, now I know the way over. Like I know that  it's not easy. But I also don't look forward and think there's no way over or I'll never know the  way over. It's like, no, I've been here before. And it sucks that I'm back here. But I can get out.  Like, and I think that that's what's really hard in a moment, especially when you're hurting from  something that you're not used to dealing with is that you don't know the way over yet. And sometimes  like that is the lesson in that moment is now you know the way over from this place. All right,  John, I've got a question for you. It's from Daisy. I'm going to read it right now, cool.  Great. Dear Hank and John, my husband and I have been married for over five years now.  Together for eight and we always said we would be ready for kids at five years to give us time to  enjoy just being a married couple before we start a family. But five years has come and neither of us  feel well ready. Like I want kids. I want a family. But I don't have that I need a baby feeling  that I thought I would have. But part of me thinks that maybe that feeling will never come.  I've never been a baby person. And so the choice to have kids might be more driven by logic than  desire. Like this is a good time to start a family rather than I want a kid now. We are starting to  get the times taken comments from friends and family. But I don't want to make that important of  a decision based on others opinion. How do you know when you're ready to start a family? "
18,0:12:11,0:13:10,SPEAKER 1," This is a tough one. I think it really obviously it depends. And it's got to be a conversation with  your partner. For us, I don't think it was really a profound feeling of like we need to have a  baby in our lives. It was to be honest at least for me like more of a sort of I'm ready to enter  that part of my life now. And I'm excited to enter that part of my life now. Like we'd moved to  Indianapolis from New York and we had a lawn and we had a home and everything and there was a bedroom.  There was nothing to do with the bedroom. Henry, if you ever listen to this, I want to be clear that  I did not bring you into the world because we had a spare bedroom. But I don't know, Henry,  that sounds like that's what he's saying. We did. We did have a spare bedroom. Like there was room  in our lives for a kid which made it made it kind of make sense. I mean, I totally get that like in "
19,0:13:10,0:15:06,SPEAKER 2," some ways I am more prepared to be a mother than I have ever been in my entire life. And I am also  at a point where I am more adamant about making that decision exactly when I feel like it's right  than ever before. And you know, I did the opposite. You know, of a you and Sarah, I moved from  Indianapolis to New York. So now I'm in Brooklyn in this, you know, I mean, it's a good apartment,  but listen, I'm born and raised Hoosier. So for the amount of money that I'm spending, I still,  even though I like my apartment, often look at it and just get mad at it and kind of want to  like kick it or like, you know, or something because I'm like, all of this money, all of this  money for a one bedroom apartment and, you know, it's more like what I pay now in, you know, rent  is literally, I'm not kidding you. Literally five times what I paid when I was living in Indian apolis to share a four bedroom condo with two other people. And right. Yeah, that doesn't surprise me at  all. So it's so I'm very much, you know, my boyfriend and I, my partner and I Kelly, we are very  much of the mind that like, yet we might want to have kids at some point, but not here, you know,  every time I see somebody, every time we see somebody carrying a stroller up the subway steps,  we're like, why, why are you doing this to yourself? Like, there are places I promise where you  and it won't be like this. Like, it won't be this hard. And kids in New York just seem so jaded.  They're like at the Museum of Natural History looking at dinosaur bones, like, oh, again,  and I'm just like, what? They're dinosaurs, man, and kids here don't care about dinosaurs. "
20,0:15:06,0:16:43,SPEAKER 1," They're just like, I know, they're all little holding coffeeels. That's how I felt when I lived  in New York. I would always be like, oh, they're just, they're just the sweetest little holding  coffeeels everywhere you look. They are. But people, people do have babies in Brooklyn. In fact,  like, lots of them. Lots of them. So many. There are tons of strollers in Brooklyn. But yeah,  I feel, I mean, I think the reason I feel the same way is probably because I grew up, you know, in  in a suburban America. And so when I thought of having kids, I imagined lawns and neighborhoods and  cookouts and all the things that were part of my childhood. And so we never really considered  having kids when we lived in New York, although for the record, lots of people do it and do it  very successfully. I have many friends who live in New York and have kids and their kids are  lovely. It just was never in the cards for us. But yeah, I, I do think there's an element of it  never being quite the right time. The other thing is that on occasion, you know, the decision is made  for you. Yeah. Or in the case of Sarah and I, we thought we had a ton of control over the timing.  And then it turned out, of course, like we didn't. So, you know, it, there's an, there's an  element of, of, of chance to it that I don't know. You can potentially work that into your considerations.  But yeah, I think, I think ultimately probably the place to make that decision is not  while listening to the pod, but while talking to your partner. I agree. But I, and you know, like, "
21,0:16:43,0:18:21,SPEAKER 2," it's just one of those things where I'm glad to see someone, especially a woman, exploring,  you know, their decision making when it comes to having a baby. Like, I'm really glad to see  a woman stopping and saying, wait, like, am I doing this because I want to do it? Or am I doing it  because it's on a checklist and it's just the next thing. You know, I have so many, um,  women friends from college, you know, who have had babies at this point, um, on purpose and a couple  of them not on purpose, you know, but, you know, they have these babies and some of them are very  much like, you know, I had my baby. I wanted to have my baby and now I have them and it's the best  thing in the world. And others of them are like, I wish I'd waited. I wish I didn't think that like,  you know, well, I got married and then we bought a house. So now I have to have a baby. You know,  and I'm glad to see someone exploring that and really thinking about what they actually want and  what family looks like for them because not every family includes kids and that's totally okay.  And, you know, there are a lot of different ways to be a family. So start, you know, like,  I think it's important that, you know, if you're asking yourself, yourself these questions,  to just keep asking them. And I think eventually the answer will come to you. I think at some point,  it does become pretty clear whether you're going to do it or not. Right. And when that happens,  you know, it's just, it's really comforting to know that like this is not something I rushed into "
22,0:18:21,0:18:51,SPEAKER 1," and it's something that I really thought about. Yeah, no, I think that's a great point. And I do  think it's really important for women to be able to have those open conversations about  having kids, bringing kids up, not having to pretend like it's always easy or always fun or  like the pressure surrounding, especially I think motherhood don't exist because they do.  And the social societal pressures are really, really intense. "
23,0:18:52,0:19:50,SPEAKER 2," They are. Yeah. No doubt about it. And someone who was a nanny, as someone who was a nanny for several  years, I could tell you like the pressure on moms is intense. Yeah. And not so for nannies.  Okay. And he's like, we can really do whatever we want to be perfectly honest. Like the kids I  used to nanny, I still, you know, I go spend a couple days with them before Christmas almost every  year. Every time I'm in Indiana, I try to go see them. We all end up sleeping in the same bed.  It's the most fun in the world. But at the same time, I'm so aware. I'm so aware that like their mom  has done so much, like so much. And I just get to be fun miss Ashley shows up and doesn't have to  deal with like the mommy politics. So when I teach them to say, you know, terrible things, it's  because I can get away with that. And it's fun because it's miss Ashley. But if mom did it, she'd be, "
24,0:19:50,0:20:24,SPEAKER 1," you know, neglectful. Right. Yeah. All right. Ashley, I've got another question for you.  This one comes from Emma who writes, dear John and Hank, I was wondering why the space key on a  keyboard makes a different sound than all the other keys. Is it due to its size or perhaps is it  due to the urgency with which we finish our words and feel the need to get on to the next one?  I'd like to know because maybe I will now spend my study hall doing work instead of pondering this.  Oh my goodness. I think it's the finger you hit with. This is a real thing.  It is a real thing. Let's just establish that at the start. "
25,0:20:24,0:20:37,SPEAKER 2," It 100% is a real thing. I have thought about it a lot. I'm not kidding. Like the minute I read  that question, I started thinking about it. And you know what I think it is. I think it's just, "
26,0:20:37,0:20:43,SPEAKER 1, I think it's the finger that you hit the key with. I think I agree. I think it's the thumbness of it. 
27,0:20:43,0:21:04,SPEAKER 2," I think so too. I think your thumb is in my mind at least like your heaviest finger because it's  like stout and kind of fat and like weird. And also that like when you hit, at least when I hit  the space key, I'm always hitting it with the side and not even like the pad of my finger. "
28,0:21:04,0:22:39,SPEAKER 1," Right. It's not a fingertip. The way you hit a J. So there's actually a word for like the way  the keyboard feels when you push the key action. It's called the key action is when you push down  and the way that that feels and how different it feels on different keyboards. And in my early  writing career, I have OCD, but I would argue that this isn't necessarily a compulsive thing.  But I was very, very obsessive about key action and different keyboards. And this before I got  a laptop, I kept the same keyboard through several computers while I was writing looking for Alaska  because I felt very strongly that the key action was what made it possible for me to write well.  And when I would try other keyboards, I would be like, no, no, no, that sounds all wrong.  That's extremely distracting. Who could possibly write a good novel with this terrible keyboard?  So I would just take the old keyboard that I'd had since college and reinstall it into the new  computer. And I eventually got over that, but I did use a different keyboard for each book that I  wrote until the last five years, until the end of the fault in our stars. And now I've decided  to be a little bit less specific about it, but it is. It's so real, the way the keys feel when  you're writing. It's so real. It's part of the magic for me. It's so real. I still, you know, "
29,0:22:39,0:24:19,SPEAKER 2," I started writing on PCs. And so going to the map, which obviously has such a different key  action from the piece when you're on a map, I hated it. Like I immediately hated it. Like  low, like what I would, I used to, we didn't have a computer in our house until I was really like  either right before I went to college or after I went to college. Did we have a computer in our  home? But the library was very close to my home. And my brother and I used to walk to the library  all the time to use the computers. And I was the kid who would sign up specifically for a PC  computer. And I would wait like I would be like, there are five max open. And I would be like,  I don't care. I do not care. I will wait here. Don't mind me. I'm over here rereading this like  Lucille Ball biography. And then I'm going to walk over and do like my thing on the computer,  which to be fair was mostly like me writing stories about my life, which were real. But that I  pretended to, you know, fiction life. And then I'm looking up to see if anybody was posting lyrics  from Kinne logins albums because I love them. And I wanted to make sure I was singing the words,  right. But back then, not a lot of people were posting Kinne logins lyrics on the internet. So "
30,0:24:20,0:24:38,SPEAKER 1," yeah, I mean, you probably could have cornered that market if only you'd had a computer at home  by launching the definitive Kinne logins lyrics website. This is a thing that I find completely  fascinating about you. You are unironically deeply passionate about the songs of Kinne logins. "
31,0:24:38,0:24:45,SPEAKER 2," Yes. Absolutely. 100%. Like not even, yeah, like not even funny. Like it's, it's real. It's very very "
32,0:24:45,0:24:58,SPEAKER 1," important. Yeah, no, it does. Yeah. And I think it's great. I'm in favor of people being super  enthusiastic and unembarassed about the stuff that they love, whether that's Kinne logins albums "
33,0:24:58,0:26:12,SPEAKER 2," or anything else. Well, you know, I just like, I've always, people ask me this a lot. Like,  I've had quite a few people who have met me in person who first met me on the internet. And they  will be like, you are so much of who you are on the internet. Like it's all the same. And I'm like,  oh, I'm just like, this is not, I'm just really bad at pretending. Like super bad at it. Like,  I'm really terrible at it. Like I can't keep it up. The thing is, is that like I could, you know,  have an account online or, you know, wherever and like sort of pretend to be a different way for  a little while. And then I would just be so exhausted that you'd be like, Ashley, what's wrong  with you? Like I would be like a robot shutting down. Like I would start to say things that didn't  make sense. And you'd be like, what's happening? And I would be like, I was pretending. And I'm sorry.  I have to go back to being me now, which means I'm going to like listen to celebrate me home  a lot. And also means like, you know, the return to Pooh Corner album is my faith. You know, I'm  going to watch Golden Girls a lot. I'm going to watch the nanny a lot. It's like these are just  things that are part of who I am. And you know, they're not harmful. So what do I have to hide? I guess. "
34,0:26:13,0:27:10,SPEAKER 1," I think it's great. And I think it encourages everybody who has their weird, the weird thing that  they love to love it without any hesitation or embarrassment. And Emma, that includes you and  your fascination with keyboards, which I am 100% behind. So Ashley and I theorize that it is because  you're hitting the space bar with the side of your stoutest digit that causes the thud. But I will  say, I don't think there is anything in my life that I like more than when I'm writing and it's  going well. And that sense of it's almost like the rhythmic thud of the space bar is it's almost  like that's the like you're driving at night. And that's the that's the site of those lane lines  going past your car or something. It's just tremendously fulfilling to hit that space bar and feel "
35,0:27:10,0:27:37,SPEAKER 2, like you're moving. I imagine it's what people who write or have written on type writers a lot  feel when they hear that little like ding at the end when there's like that thing that's just like  ding. And then like it goes back to the other side. It's like wow. It's like another row. How dare I  be this amazing? Like how dare I be this awesome to like just hear all these dings while I'm writing. 
36,0:27:37,0:27:54,SPEAKER 1, Like I'm on fire over here. Yeah. Yeah. It's that feeling. It's that that's the feeling of like  being on fire. And I totally agree with you about the Mac keyboard being utterly suboptible when  it comes to that feeling because there's almost no key action in these keys. No. There's almost none. 
37,0:27:54,0:28:30,SPEAKER 2," It feels like like there's little pillows under them or something. And I'm like, I don't  need it. Yeah. I don't want pillows under my keys, man. Like I want like I don't even want key  action. I want key impact. Okay. Like I want it to come together. And I want to like hear like  the click click click like I need it. So yeah. That's basically where we stand on these keyboards.  I have frequently wondered if I should just like do the thing where you put your Mac up on like a  stand. And then have like your PC keyboard attached to it that you type. Yeah. Yeah. Because maybe "
38,0:28:30,0:30:11,SPEAKER 1," I have thought of doing that. But then I think like that when I if if people ask me about that  when I am explaining it, I'm going to seem like I'm totally out of touch with reality. But I'm  really glad to know that I'm not that you agree with me about this on this. We definitely agree, John.  This question is from Isaiah who asked, sorry, Ashley and I are laughing at something that you  guys didn't get to hear. Um, this question comes from Isaiah who asks, dear John and Hank, I'm  worth it. I'm using a very special skill for years. I've been a practitioner of jazz music. I've  spent thousands of hours studying theory, practicing rehearsing and jamming and even forming a spiritual  realization of music. However, as a young person rising through the ranks, I quickly realized that  music pays way fewer bills than I ever imagined. We all know that musicians rarely make much  from records nowadays. But at least in Chicago venues don't pay for live shows either. I've sold all  my tickets to House of Blues twice on Friday nights and went home with zero dollars.  I was lucky enough to make it into Evanston Illinois's most famous university which by the way,  Isaiah counts my wife among their alumni to study biology, which I enjoy. I make a modest living  with a low ceiling as a teacher. However, the feeling of being me felt different when I was better at  jazz. I haven't completely stopped playing but without spending hours on it each day, I feel rusty  and I wonder if I've spent my whole life feeling rusty.  That question makes me a little sad. I know it's a hard one because this is a true fact of being  an artist or making things for a living or performing for a living which is that many times it isn't "
39,0:30:11,0:31:40,SPEAKER 2," you're whipping. Yeah. Yeah, it's really hard to do that and that's not Isaiah's fault. That's no  artist fault for the most part. The biggest fault is that people tend to devalue work that is  enjoyed while it is being made. So it's like if you liked it then why am I paying you for it? And  that's unfortunate and I think that's sort of the wrong way to go but it is kind of the way things  are right now and it's hard. It's hard when you love something and you study it and you devote  all this time to it and then feel like you can't maintain that level of expertise or that level  of production or whatever but at the same time, I think sometimes we have to shift our idea  of what art is for and I think that while we want to be experts and we want to be people who are  always at the top of our game in art that you have to make a decision somewhere along the line about  whether or not that's something that you can actually do and also whether or not that's something  you can sustain and it's just such a hard question and it's so private I think really person. "
40,0:31:40,0:35:24,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, I mean it is very much like a case to case thing. I mean I come at this from an incredibly  privileged position because I've been able to make a living writing for a long time now. I mean  for the first several years that I was writing and even when I was writing semi-professionally,  I didn't but I have for the last nine or ten years but I do have maybe like an analogous  experience in the sense that after my book The Fault in Our Stars came out for a long time I wasn't  writing because I was doing other things because there was movie stuff happening and our crash course  channel was taking off educational video channel that Hank and I started and and then also because  writing became unfun and I started to feel rusty and I started to feel like I wasn't good at it  anymore and like maybe I was never going to be good at it again and there are lots of examples  of this happening like it's not an irrational fear you know I mean there's famous stories of  people who were among the best golfers in the world for instance and one day they picked up their  clubs and found that they could no longer play golf well there's a very famous example of a  baseball player who made three straight throwing errors in the major leagues after a very successful  major league career and never again was able to play major league baseball like just was never  able to do it again never could complete the throws and and of course like in the case of  writing there's lots and lots and lots and lots of examples of people like that from you know  wonderful writers who had very successful careers like Harper Lee to many many writers out there  like including my great uncle who wrote one novel and then founded Impossible to write another  whether it was the first one was successful or not so I did I started to feel rusty and I also  felt like it was something that I could never do again or never never enjoy again I found though  for me that by keeping at it and by continuing to try to write that it got better I didn't stop  feeling rusty and I still probably think that and I'm not well I'll just say this I still do  probably think that my best writing is behind me in a lot of ways but I was it what I found was  an ability to enjoy writing again because I stopped making it about wanting to be the best or  wanting to be better than some past version of myself or better than other people I admire a lot  who write why a fiction or better than this or better than that and instead of seeing it as like  a pyramid or something that you're trying to get to the top of I started seeing it as a huge ball  that I'm trying to like contribute one layer of paint to and lots and lots of other people are  contributing layers of paint and through that the ball gets more beautiful and interesting and also  bigger and and instead of me being needing to be like at the top of my game somehow what I can  really do I think in the end is contribute in a small way to a very big conversation that's very  old and and that's what art is for me oh my gosh John you're really messing me up right now because "
41,0:35:24,0:38:23,SPEAKER 2, I mean so many you know like my fears as a writer as a performer and as someone who you know  needs to make a living are so wrapped up and a lot of you know those same thoughts and those same  you know like the restiness and the you know what if I have already done the best thing I'm ever  going to do and right I think you know as someone who has a day job somebody who has a place that  she has to be you know like every day even though even even in terms of like day jobs I'm still  kind of sitting pretty because I have unlimited vacation at my job and also you know they understand  that I'm a writer and do other things and you know allow me room and space to do those things which  is not true for everybody or even most people who have day jobs um but you know I have a lot of  those fears that by having this day job or you know by doing things that are not just sitting down  and writing that I'm not being a good writer and that I won't ever be a better writer because of  those things you know but sometimes I'm like you know some things you just they're important and  they are part of living a fool and whole life as an artist and that's important not just for your  art but also for the way you experience the world in general like at the end of the day we're people  you know and we might be artist people but we are still people and people have to eat and people  have to have somewhere to live and people have to have you know certain things to feel you know  comfortable and feel like they can get to a place where they can even create in the way that they  want to you know so I don't know I guess I'm just saying that you know I feel like tonight I should  be working on my book but instead I'm interviewing Zadie Smith you know and that does not feel  pretty great actually right but my point is like that doesn't feel like being less of a writer  that doesn't feel like being less of an artist that doesn't feel like I'm throwing away some future  and I think I think that the key to art that we forget sometimes is joy and you know you talking  about finding the joy and being able to enjoy writing again I think I don't think that the  problem with Isaiah is that you know because he can't spend hours a day he'll never be happy  I think he sort of has to redefine why and how music gives him joy and why how and why playing  music gives him you know space to feel like more of himself or the person that he wants to be 
42,0:38:23,0:39:10,SPEAKER 1, yeah I think that's exactly right and I think ultimately the conclusion that I've come to about  writing is that regardless of whether I ever publish anything again writing helps me feel like  myself it helps me it is it's like it's it's joyful for me it's the only it's kind of the only time  that for me that I can get lost enough in something I feel this occasionally when I read  when I can get lost enough in something that I feel like I can escape myself for a minute  uh which is very joyful thing like it to me it's sort of terrifying the thought of being stuck inside  of one uh one consciousness for for decades and decades I couldn't do it I couldn't do it like I'm 
43,0:39:10,0:39:44,SPEAKER 2, already I already have a hard time just like you know I tried meditating and meditating sounds  so awesome in theory and I really want to do it because I really want to be the kind of person  who can do it and every time I'm just like well it is like it's not safe in here I can't just be in  here like for 10 minutes I totally agree it is not safe in here and you know maybe that's its own  problem maybe I should be talking to somebody more about that but you know I mean I completely agree 
44,0:39:44,0:40:23,SPEAKER 1, with you and I know that I'm I'm actually having to meditate every day because of this new health  and fitness show that I'm doing on youtube youtube.com slash 100 days never not self-promoing and um  it's not going great uh and lots of people are telling me oh you're just meditating wrong and I'm  like you know what criticizing my meditation is also not helpful like that's not that's also not  getting me to where I need to be right now like because before when I wasn't meditating at all  I was happier and now with you criticizing my meditation on top of not enjoying the meditation 
45,0:40:23,0:40:53,SPEAKER 2, at you're making everything worse everything's worse now thanks for nothing meditation like just believe  you didn't do right by me meditation I thought this it's just one of those things where it's like it's  just it is not going well and boy did I give it my best shot but you know what there are other things  to master in this world and I should probably move along this just this one just this one just 
46,0:40:53,0:41:16,SPEAKER 1, ain't for me I talked to my friend Josh Sunquist about meditation he's a big advocate for it and he  was like oh I didn't see any uh much improvement at all in the first year and I was like I can't do  something for a year where I don't see any improvement I can just barely brush my teeth every day for a  year like knowing that there are real risks to not like there's no way I'm gonna be able to put 
47,0:41:16,0:42:05,SPEAKER 2, in the time necessary to get these rewards I just like I'm so with you on this and it's like a  thing about myself that infuriates me about myself but also it's like I just have to know that  that's true like I just spent a lot of money on a personal trainer who I've seen like four times  and now I'm kind of like I think I got all I needed out of that I don't think I'm the kind of  person who personally trades you know after after just like a few sessions because I was like hmm  I'm not really losing any weight here uh yeah I don't really feel better people were like your  energy is gonna get better and I was like nah I've just been sleeping more so no I'm okay I'm 
48,0:42:05,0:43:29,SPEAKER 1, yeah I mean you really do I have found benefits to exercise but it is totally true that they are not  immediate um but yeah I'm I should go well but I don't just take care of yourself in whatever ways  you can find uh we should move on to the news from Mars and AFC Wimbledon Ashley I know this is  your favorite part of the podcast and also the listeners just kidding it absolutely ain't nobody  likes it the news from Mars I looked up some news from Mars for you people it was physically painful  I did not enjoy it Mars is a boring cold rock in the vastness of space it doesn't matter however  since Hank is not here I did hook up some news from Mars and they've just found a depression on Mars  not caused by the election but caused by a crater at the edge of the hellis basin uh which is  surrounded by glacial deposits and is near to another similar depression and the nature of this  depression is such that it has uh it was likely a place where life would have formed if life  indeed formed on Mars um so they now know a place that they can go look for life on Mars if and when  anybody ever gets to Mars which will hopefully not happen till 2028 because if it doesn't happen  until 2028 we get to rename this podcast dear john and hank which is my dearest dream I don't know 
49,0:43:29,0:44:02,SPEAKER 2, that is the news from Mars I don't know john I think uh post election people might be speeding up  their mind I am concerned I'm not saying I'm a little concerned true I'm not saying that I've  heard rumors but I am saying that I live in New York City and talk gets around okay and  I am saying that you know Mars is looking uh better and better every day john and that's not 
50,0:44:02,0:46:08,SPEAKER 1, a personal opinion I I think no no yeah yeah I am concerned I think that this election was very bad  um for my ability to make sure that uh humans are an earth-only species until at least 2028 so I  can get this podcast renamed um we really took a hit all right so there is also news from  AFC Wimbledon uh the third-tier English soccer team sponsored by nerdfighteria owned by their  fans uh who've worked their way up all the way from the ninth tier of English football uh now  to the third tier they played the FA Cup yesterday which is a competition that uh the old  Wimbledon actually won once and uh they beat a team called Berry B-U-R-Y as in we buried them um  we beat them five to nothing we scored five goals in just 90 minutes and we won five to nothing  who scored the goals fricking everybody everybody scored uh it was it it was amazing Paul Robinson scored  a goal uh Dom Polly and scored a goal the the the Montserratian Messi Lyle Taylor scored a goal uh the  the the leading score of on Montserrat's uh national football team Lyle Taylor uh scored a goal as well  it was just it was a beautiful beautiful game five nothing victory uh you can watch the highlights  on youtube the the youtube highlight uh real is like 17 minutes long because it's just the goals  just kept coming uh yeah it was great uh that means that we're going to the second round of the FA Cup  uh where we're going to play a team in the sixth tier uh we the draw has already happened  and it's uh I want to give you the name because I know that I know how much this matters to everybody  the name of the team is Kersen Ashton uh and if we win that game uh we will then get to the third  round of the FA Cup where we could potentially play like Manchester United or Chelsea or something  could be incredibly exciting and also quite lucrative John what I know yeah I know I know it's 
51,0:46:08,0:47:01,SPEAKER 2, pretty great the last time I looked up stuff about AFC Wembleden I was actually super shocked at their  ranking um in the third tier but I had but I had I know which was like they were only like I think  last time I looked they had 17 points um but now things have gotten even better things have  gotten even better for AFC Wembleden which makes me very happy um because I decided to get into  club soccer a little bit over the past two years uh which was heavily influenced by your  enthusiasm so I know a little bit about a little bit but here's my question that you know like  I'm wondering what does it mean if AFC Wembleden were to be a Manchester United 
52,0:47:03,0:48:19,SPEAKER 1, uh I mean it would be it would be like in the scheme of things like probably nothing because then  they would just in the next round draw another team like Manchester United that would presumably  at some point beat them yeah but in it of course like in the in the long run nothing matters you know  if you want to really zoom out like nothing matters in football or or in anything else uh so  so you don't want to zoom all the way out right like you want to live in the moment and in the  moment it would be ridiculous like it would be it would be the it would just be uh it would be so  beautiful especially if it was Manchester United the team I hate most in the whole world except  maybe Chelsea if it were Manchester United or Chelsea it would feel so good especially Chelsea  because they also play in South London so like they're sort of rivals with AFC Wembleden but of  course Chelsea has never paused to consider AFC Wembleden as a rival um that was too pretty great  but that's why they need their butt kicked yeah totally totally yeah they need to be reminded that  that there's another team in South London that's coming for them that's the thing it's like sometimes 
53,0:48:19,0:48:23,SPEAKER 2, you don't need to win all the games you just need them to know you're coming like you just need 
54,0:48:23,0:48:40,SPEAKER 1," them to know that like hey I'm around yeah you just need them to be just a just the thought of them  being aware of you is tremendously fulfilling you know yeah like the thought of them having to worry  about it having to be like oh gosh which of our players who make $200,000 a week are we gonna start "
55,0:48:40,0:48:56,SPEAKER 2, against AFC Wembleden that's how I feel about my enemies personally I'm not really trying  to like do anything to them I just need them to know I'm around there is something tremendously 
56,0:48:56,0:49:04,SPEAKER 1, fulfilling about your enemies worrying about you yeah I only have two but should I ever acquire 
57,0:49:05,0:49:43,SPEAKER 2, more enemies I hope not I don't really like having enemies because then you have to think about  them and that seems it's stressful it's stressful and wasteful there are so many things to be  thinking about in the world and just like enemies seems like the worst thing to have to think about  except like going to the dentist which you know does seem like a pretty you know like like a like  not like a waste but definitely like I wish I didn't have to think about that and I feel like  enemies are kind of the same way like I just wish I never had to think about my two enemies  who are also both in their 70s so maybe I won't they're in their 70s yeah oh so I mean 
58,0:49:44,0:49:54,SPEAKER 1, obviously I'm not gonna I'm not gonna ask you to name them because that gives your enemies power  may not want to give them that power but I love your chances of outliving them 
59,0:49:55,0:50:32,SPEAKER 2, my chances are great I mean not just based on like age but also based on like general  wilderness survival skills of which I have many and they have curling and so I just like I feel like  no matter what happens I'm still probably going to outlive them just because of my like  just because my just because of my wilderness skills and also because of my general youth which is  you know just slipping slipping by the day I'll be 30 in January no oh you're so young 
60,0:50:33,0:50:54,SPEAKER 1, oh to be so young um I'm glad to know though that in the like uh post social order collapse mr  robot future that we're all headed for uh your your wilderness survival skills are gonna come in handy  because I will be knocking on the door of your tent you better you can come through john you can 
61,0:50:54,0:51:35,SPEAKER 2, totally come through um you and your fan listen my boyfriend uh is really great with a bow and  arrow I oh wow great I'm great at sewing and cooking and building fires uh I was a boy scout  post high school so I just learned a bunch because that's what I do I'm an information junkie  and then I just would practice it sometimes because I'm just I'm also an anxiety junkie and so  every once in a while like now like this whole structure this whole like civilized like society nope  could come crashing down any minute I gotta be ready I gotta be so I agree that it's it's 
62,0:51:35,0:52:20,SPEAKER 1, exceptionally fragile but I haven't done a good job preparing I am uh a reasonably astute  starter of fires so perhaps that can be the way that I contribute yes you're in you're in the club  all I need is a lighter and a duraflame okay I can get a fire started 99 times out of 100  might I have a laugh you might be out of the club well uh Ashley thank you so much  for being on the podcast with me this has been an unadulterated joy I want to tell everybody  to follow you on twitter to keep up with all the things that you're doing even though you are  taking and I think this is very smart the remainder of november off uh from twitter uh I might 
63,0:52:20,0:52:32,SPEAKER 2, be back sooner though for my job because I might be taking a road trip like an interesting little  road trip that uh requires my twitter usage so we'll see we'll see that sounds exciting um but yeah 
64,0:52:32,0:54:00,SPEAKER 1, so you can follow uh Ashley on twitter at i-smashfizzle i-s-m-a-s-h-f-i-z-e-l-a nope f-i-z-e-z-e-l-e I'm really  bad at spelling it's just the exact way that you would think i-s-m-a-s-fizzle is spelled yeah no it's  so phonetic it's very very easy it's not a challenging uh twitter handle to spell uh you can  also find me on twitter at john green j-o-h-n-g-r-a-n and um uh you can send us emails at hank and john  at gmail.com that's all one word hank and john at gmail.com uh yeah so you can you can be in contact  with us and we will try to answer as many of your questions as possible i apologize to all the people  who uh we didn't answer your questions i also uh want to apologize to all the trends out there  because in a recent episode of the podcast uh hank used the word the name trend as an example of a  millennial name i made fun of hank uh for that uh several trends felt that that was a bit of a  personal slight so i just want to say to all the trends out there just because you almost certainly  aren't a millennial doesn't mean that there's anything wrong with your lovely name  and i'm sorry if i implied otherwise and in fact if you are a millennial i'm sorry about implying  that you weren't if you want to be a millennial which seems like a dubious proposition to me but  whatever it's your life actually thank you so much though for uh for for potting with me this is
