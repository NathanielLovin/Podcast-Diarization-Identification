7,0:00:32,0:00:34,SPEAKER 2, Don't call me not a Patreon member.

9,0:00:36,0:00:38,SPEAKER 2, That cat is so cute.

11,0:00:39,0:01:07,SPEAKER 2," What a lot of we're trying to say is our merch is coming out  because it's sold out really fast from doing it again.  And we have a hat that we're selling now, new item.  And if you're a tier 3 or tier 4 on the Patreon,  you can get it early because last time it sold out in two minutes  which we did not expect to happen.  But just scared us.  If you want to get it before it sells out, you can join the Patreon.  If you want to gamble, which is kind of tight,  it'll be out Monday.  But it'll be out Thursday.  This Thursday.  Wait, today?

15,0:01:13,0:01:16,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, so now let's go into the actual goddamn episode.  Discounting for $5 off. "
16,0:01:16,0:01:17,SPEAKER 3, That's not a discount. 
17,0:01:17,0:01:19,SPEAKER 2, Not a real discount.  Not a discount. 
18,0:01:19,0:01:21,SPEAKER 3, We're not trying it.  But you should try it. 
19,0:01:21,0:01:24,SPEAKER 1, It won't work.  And it won't work.  We don't know. 
20,0:01:24,0:01:27,SPEAKER 4, It's actually crazy because we do know.  Enjoy the art. 
21,0:01:27,0:01:28,SPEAKER 2, We enjoy the art. 
22,0:01:28,0:01:32,SPEAKER 3, Maybe.  We were doing Mormon family pictures.  Is that what does that mean? 
23,0:01:32,0:01:34,SPEAKER 1, Is that a genre?  It is. 
24,0:01:34,0:01:39,SPEAKER 3, It's like the pictures you see in a target  when you buy a picture frame and it's a family that's there.  It's the default. 
25,0:01:39,0:01:40,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
26,0:01:40,0:01:45,SPEAKER 3," I saw it get made.  I saw the sausage.  They were all standing there.  They were like white dresses, "
27,0:01:45,0:01:46,SPEAKER 1, blush dresses. 
28,0:01:46,0:01:51,SPEAKER 3," And it was like in an ocean that was packed,  but we were just there anyway.  It's sunset. "
29,0:01:51,0:01:54,SPEAKER 2, Were they wearing their ears?  They're like Disney ears all in the... 
30,0:01:54,0:01:55,SPEAKER 3, I wish. 
31,0:01:56,0:01:58,SPEAKER 1, With all their names in the cursive font on the video. 
32,0:01:58,0:02:02,SPEAKER 4, It's like all the family members.  And then there's like many Mickey and Goofy. 
33,0:02:02,0:02:03,SPEAKER 1, Like on the side. 
34,0:02:03,0:02:10,SPEAKER 3," We brought cash members.  Yeah.  It was really expensive.  But I took the pictures,  and then you get wet during it.  By the way, the photographer. "
35,0:02:10,0:02:11,SPEAKER 1, I bet you do. 
36,0:02:11,0:02:14,SPEAKER 2, I bet you do.  What's up? 
37,0:02:14,0:02:18,SPEAKER 3," During the photographer's zero flash,  shooting into the sunset. "
38,0:02:18,0:02:20,SPEAKER 2, Baller.  Fuck it. 
39,0:02:20,0:02:21,SPEAKER 1," Wait, is that... "
40,0:02:21,0:02:22,SPEAKER 3, Canon 3D. 
41,0:02:22,0:02:25,SPEAKER 2, Let's get it.  Canon 3D. 
42,0:02:25,0:02:28,SPEAKER 3," I got camera.  When I said it, I felt like it was... "
43,0:02:28,0:02:29,SPEAKER 1," I know, you're like computer. "
44,0:02:29,0:02:33,SPEAKER 2," What's that?  It makes 3D.  Yeah, the cool thing about Mormon family photos "
45,0:02:33,0:02:36,SPEAKER 4, is you put on the red and blue glasses from Spikes. 
46,0:02:36,0:02:37,SPEAKER 1, Can you look at them? 
47,0:02:37,0:02:41,SPEAKER 2," Dude, when you go to the family photos.  That'll be so tight. "
48,0:02:41,0:02:44,SPEAKER 3, It shoots out like the smell.  So it's 4D. 
49,0:02:44,0:02:56,SPEAKER 2," It's just all your nipples.  So it's a shirtless family photo.  And all your nipples have the 3D film on it.  I actually don't really know how it works.  And then you wear the red cyan glasses  and all the nipples are coming in.  I like that, yeah. "
50,0:02:56,0:03:00,SPEAKER 4, It's tradition in the Mormon home  to offer your guest a pair of glasses 
51,0:03:00,0:03:01,SPEAKER 3, so that they can look at nipples. 
52,0:03:01,0:03:03,SPEAKER 2, They can enjoy all your photos in your home. 
53,0:03:03,0:03:12,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, they can view the photos nicely.  And the longer the nipples,  the longer you've been in the family.  It's like rings on a tree.  And you're the... "
54,0:03:12,0:03:13,SPEAKER 2, It'll long in the nipple. 
55,0:03:13,0:03:16,SPEAKER 1, It'll long in the nipple.  The headband of the house.  You have the longest nipples in that house. 
56,0:03:16,0:03:19,SPEAKER 2, They say Joseph Smith used to tie them in... 
57,0:03:19,0:03:20,SPEAKER 1, That's right. 
58,0:03:20,0:03:24,SPEAKER 3," Really, I imagine them all was erect  and never flopping down. "
59,0:03:24,0:03:27,SPEAKER 1," Well, yeah, that's part of God's will.  Is that he keeps you? "
60,0:03:27,0:03:30,SPEAKER 4, It's absolutely tentative at Thanksgiving. 
61,0:03:32,0:03:33,SPEAKER 3, Why do pigs are crazed? 
62,0:03:33,0:03:35,SPEAKER 1, It's my dad who's beautiful tits. 
63,0:03:36,0:03:50,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, you can tell he's a grandmaster.  Anyway, my pants got wet.  And so I only could wear cuties pants  which were booty shorts given to her by her mother-in-law.  And I was wearing that to a Brazilian steakhouse. "
64,0:03:50,0:03:51,SPEAKER 1, Right. 
65,0:03:51,0:03:53,SPEAKER 3, No go.  It was one of the shorts that... 
66,0:03:53,0:04:05,SPEAKER 1," They got a dress code.  Underwear leaks under.  They said we might be Brazilian,  but we still got to wear some pants.  Yeah.  Okay.  I know it gets hot down there,  but this is a steakhouse, sir. "
67,0:04:05,0:04:06,SPEAKER 3, But I had to buy cords. 
68,0:04:06,0:04:08,SPEAKER 1, They call you fail. 
69,0:04:09,0:04:10,SPEAKER 3, No? 
70,0:04:10,0:04:12,SPEAKER 1, What does that mean?  No. 
71,0:04:12,0:04:13,SPEAKER 3, Ugly. 
72,0:04:13,0:04:15,SPEAKER 2," Well, I got there.  That's right. "
73,0:04:15,0:04:16,SPEAKER 1, Is it also ugly in Portuguese?  Fail. 
74,0:04:16,0:04:18,SPEAKER 3," There's no need for language, right? "
75,0:04:18,0:04:18,SPEAKER 1, It's fail. 
76,0:04:20,0:04:20,SPEAKER 3, You're making that up. 
77,0:04:20,0:04:22,SPEAKER 1, No. 
78,0:04:22,0:04:22,SPEAKER 2," Wait, what? "
79,0:04:22,0:04:26,SPEAKER 4," Did you just say it in Spanish?  And then yes, it was the same as... "
80,0:04:26,0:04:28,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, it is.  You made it TH. "
81,0:04:30,0:04:32,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, which would be...  I feel like it's more of a joke about people in Spain. "
82,0:04:32,0:04:36,SPEAKER 1," No, no, no.  I was in the first time.  I meant the first time. "
83,0:04:36,0:04:36,SPEAKER 2, What's going on? 
84,0:04:36,0:04:38,SPEAKER 3," Welcome back to Yard, everybody.  Episode 54. "
85,0:04:38,0:04:40,SPEAKER 2," Dude, the 54. "
86,0:04:40,0:04:42,SPEAKER 3, I was hoping you'd let it go. 
87,0:04:42,0:04:44,SPEAKER 2, That would mean that we're past a year. 
88,0:04:44,0:04:46,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, we wouldn't have done anything cool for a year. "
89,0:04:46,0:04:46,SPEAKER 2, I think this is 45. 
90,0:04:46,0:04:48,SPEAKER 4, Is it been a full year already? 
91,0:04:48,0:04:52,SPEAKER 1," No, it hasn't.  That's what...  No.  I got him. "
92,0:04:52,0:04:52,SPEAKER 3, I got him. 
93,0:04:52,0:04:54,SPEAKER 1, I got him. 
94,0:04:54,0:04:56,SPEAKER 3, Come on.  I stopped celebrating anniversaries. 
95,0:04:56,0:05:00,SPEAKER 1," Wait, do you do this on the purpose now?  Yeah.  How long do you do that? "
96,0:05:00,0:05:00,SPEAKER 4, I did that on purpose. 
97,0:05:00,0:05:02,SPEAKER 1, I cannot tell. 
98,0:05:02,0:05:06,SPEAKER 2," Look, the audio listeners have no idea  there's a cute-ass little cat on that right now. "
99,0:05:06,0:05:08,SPEAKER 1, Little cat. 
100,0:05:08,0:05:10,SPEAKER 2, Hi. 
101,0:05:10,0:05:12,SPEAKER 3, And that Aiden looks like Eminem. 
102,0:05:12,0:05:12,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
103,0:05:12,0:05:14,SPEAKER 2, Yeah. 
104,0:05:14,0:05:14,SPEAKER 1, What's the fuck happened to us? 
105,0:05:14,0:05:16,SPEAKER 3, You look like one of Trump's sons. 
106,0:05:16,0:05:18,SPEAKER 1," Well, you used to be a real country. "
107,0:05:18,0:05:22,SPEAKER 2, Aiden just drank a fifth of vodka and was asking us to dare him to drive. 
108,0:05:22,0:05:26,SPEAKER 1, You look like...  You look like you're a problem at a corn con. 
109,0:05:26,0:05:28,SPEAKER 3, You look like you hang up a melt boys poster in your college dorm. 
110,0:05:28,0:05:30,SPEAKER 1, Ugh. 
111,0:05:30,0:05:32,SPEAKER 2, You look like corn.  You... 
112,0:05:32,0:05:32,SPEAKER 1," Fuck, bro. "
113,0:05:32,0:05:34,SPEAKER 3, The band. 
114,0:05:34,0:05:34,SPEAKER 1, You look like... 
115,0:05:34,0:05:36,SPEAKER 2, Not on the cob. 
116,0:05:36,0:05:44,SPEAKER 1," You look like you hang out with only high schoolers.  Well, in your 24.  In your 24. "
117,0:05:44,0:05:46,SPEAKER 3," In your 24.  In your 24.  Yeah, 25. "
118,0:05:46,0:05:48,SPEAKER 1, You got high schoolers. 
119,0:05:48,0:05:50,SPEAKER 3, Your eyebrows look better. 
120,0:05:50,0:05:52,SPEAKER 4, It's crazy because they didn't change. 
121,0:05:52,0:05:54,SPEAKER 3, I know. 
122,0:05:54,0:05:56,SPEAKER 2, Yeah.  Aiden's blonde. 
123,0:05:56,0:05:58,SPEAKER 3, He's blonde. 
124,0:05:58,0:06:02,SPEAKER 1, You look like you fucking hang out at the skate park and you've never skated. 
125,0:06:02,0:06:12,SPEAKER 2," Oh, it's fucked.  Yeah.  You look like you're at the skate park and you have a skateboard in your hand.  You're holding it by the trucks and you critique people on their tricks,  but you've never ridden around. "
126,0:06:12,0:06:14,SPEAKER 4," I'm like, I'm like Owen Wilson for the first half of that video. "
127,0:06:14,0:06:16,SPEAKER 2, No. 
128,0:06:16,0:06:16,SPEAKER 1, No. 
129,0:06:16,0:06:18,SPEAKER 2," No, you're not. "
130,0:06:18,0:06:18,SPEAKER 1," No, because he's money. "
131,0:06:18,0:06:20,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, he's money. "
132,0:06:20,0:06:24,SPEAKER 4, What?  He's money not doing any tricks.  He's criticizing everybody.  That's what you just said. 
133,0:06:24,0:06:24,SPEAKER 2," No, with them. "
134,0:06:24,0:06:26,SPEAKER 1," No, but you're... "
135,0:06:26,0:06:28,SPEAKER 2, You'll never do what he does in the second half. 
136,0:06:28,0:06:34,SPEAKER 1," Yeah.  What he does.  So, what Owen Wilson does in the second half of the video.  That's what Owen Wilson hits the boy.  What's on the kid's Santa doesn't exist. "
137,0:06:34,0:06:36,SPEAKER 2, What's wrong with you? 
138,0:06:36,0:06:40,SPEAKER 1, You don't think he hits the blunt side.  Both sides.  Get the fuck out of my house. 
139,0:06:40,0:06:44,SPEAKER 2, Front salad.  Back set.  What is it? 
140,0:06:44,0:06:44,SPEAKER 1, I got beef with you. 
141,0:06:44,0:06:48,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, front salad.  You have beef with me.  I'm mad at you. "
142,0:06:48,0:06:50,SPEAKER 4, You just roasted my hair for the past. 
143,0:06:50,0:06:52,SPEAKER 1," Which...  No, I did.  He gave the layup. "
144,0:06:52,0:06:58,SPEAKER 4, Much like the beloved album with the same name.  Everybody loves it.  Besides you three. 
145,0:06:58,0:06:58,SPEAKER 1, Album? 
146,0:06:58,0:07:00,SPEAKER 3, Long films. 
147,0:07:00,0:07:04,SPEAKER 1," You mean the TV show?  That is a joke.  Oh, I thought you were talking about the album.  Everybody loves it. "
148,0:07:04,0:07:06,SPEAKER 3," And I was like, Simon, know this artist? "
149,0:07:06,0:07:10,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.  That's an obscure punk band from the 80s. 
150,0:07:10,0:07:24,SPEAKER 3," Uh, you look, I'm mad at you because I...  You're always mad that we never hang out.  You disappear an entire week without saying a word to me.  You show up out of the blue with blonde hair.  I'm like, what the hell is this?  You're like, yeah, just do me a mim. "
151,0:07:24,0:07:26,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.  What are you with? 
152,0:07:26,0:07:28,SPEAKER 3, Where does this happen?  What did you do all week? 
153,0:07:28,0:07:32,SPEAKER 2, You guys know music video for Stan.  You've seen the M&M music video. 
154,0:07:32,0:07:36,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.  And he's writing.  And they put it in the sound. 
155,0:07:36,0:07:38,SPEAKER 2," And he's like, man, but it's Aiden.  And he's just like, um, so... "
156,0:07:38,0:07:40,SPEAKER 4, You haven't applied to me in a while. 
157,0:07:40,0:07:54,SPEAKER 2," Which is okay.  It's fine.  Because I'm actually playing Valorant Highline Fun.  I just want to make sure everything's good.  Uh, if we could like talk to each other maybe and like figure out like what the problem is  because I'd love to resolve it.  Uh, yeah.  Just like, let me know.  And if not, it's totally okay.  But I'll talk to you later. "
158,0:07:54,0:08:04,SPEAKER 1," Hey, and you don't kill yourself and your wife because you're just ultimately pretty reasonable about it.  Yeah. "
159,0:08:04,0:08:06,SPEAKER 4, But I want to deep down. 
160,0:08:06,0:08:06,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
161,0:08:06,0:08:08,SPEAKER 3, You're close. 
162,0:08:08,0:08:12,SPEAKER 4, I'm harboring.  Yeah.  The death I want to inflict. 
163,0:08:12,0:08:14,SPEAKER 3," But what's up, dude?  What happened, man?  Where's the old Aiden? "
164,0:08:14,0:08:16,SPEAKER 2, I'm just the old Aiden. 
165,0:08:16,0:08:20,SPEAKER 4," I mean, I just dyed my hair. "
166,0:08:20,0:08:24,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, but it's fun.  Yeah.  And you shouldn't have done that.  I shouldn't have done... "
167,0:08:24,0:08:24,SPEAKER 4, I've been thinking about doing this for... 
168,0:08:24,0:08:26,SPEAKER 1, I immediately asked him. 
169,0:08:26,0:08:30,SPEAKER 4," I'm like, this is you did this two years ago.  You're acting like it's this insane thing that you would never do. "
170,0:08:30,0:08:32,SPEAKER 3, It's so much different. 
171,0:08:32,0:08:38,SPEAKER 1," It's again, you're literally again comparing yourself.  This is like the own Wilson thing.  It's not even close. "
172,0:08:38,0:08:40,SPEAKER 3, Why is it different?  I am.  Because it was for content. 
173,0:08:40,0:08:42,SPEAKER 1, Was it for content? 
174,0:08:42,0:08:46,SPEAKER 3," Yeah.  I did marbles.  And it was a random, a shortman of hair colors.  It could have been pink. "
175,0:08:46,0:08:46,SPEAKER 1, And he did it on screen. 
176,0:08:46,0:08:50,SPEAKER 2," Oh, Cole, you're going to love part two of what Aiden's going to do to his hair then. "
177,0:08:50,0:08:52,SPEAKER 1, Oh.  Oh.  What? 
178,0:08:52,0:08:54,SPEAKER 4," No, I mean, you guys will see. "
179,0:08:54,0:08:54,SPEAKER 1, What are you doing? 
180,0:08:54,0:08:56,SPEAKER 3, Tyler Ninja Blevin's blue? 
181,0:08:56,0:09:00,SPEAKER 4, Yeah.  It's like if that's kind of the steps to success that I see.  Yeah. 
182,0:09:00,0:09:04,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.  It's in the master class. 
183,0:09:04,0:09:08,SPEAKER 3, It's in the master class.  Master class.  Episode three is dire hair blue.  It works every time.  We've got to cast a lot. 
184,0:09:08,0:09:10,SPEAKER 1," But, you know, you need to do it. "
185,0:09:10,0:09:12,SPEAKER 3, I just signed up for this class. 
186,0:09:12,0:09:14,SPEAKER 1, Read every hair dresser.  Oh really? 
187,0:09:14,0:09:16,SPEAKER 3, Did they reopen admission? 
188,0:09:16,0:09:16,SPEAKER 2, Are you grinding? 
189,0:09:16,0:09:18,SPEAKER 3, I'm grinding.  I'm grinding the Ninja Blevin's last. 
190,0:09:18,0:09:20,SPEAKER 2, You learn a lot. 
191,0:09:20,0:09:20,SPEAKER 3, No. 
192,0:09:20,0:09:24,SPEAKER 4, Isn't a master class like a just a video?  Why is there a set number of signups? 
193,0:09:24,0:09:40,SPEAKER 2," No, there's like, it's a curriculum.  And they have like, as far as I understand,  that you have like homework.  There's things that you have to do.  And they also have people who like review your work.  So I imagine if it was infinite signups,  they couldn't handle the amount of people. "
194,0:09:40,0:09:48,SPEAKER 4," It's got to be pretty crushing to do the homework for that class.  Because you just like boot up the stream, follow all the steps,  and still have two fucking viewers and one of them's you. "
195,0:09:48,0:09:54,SPEAKER 2," Do you think there's like an influx of like, like Fortnite players  who all stream into the exact same thing? "
196,0:09:54,0:09:56,SPEAKER 3, They all have like the same hashtag in the title. 
197,0:09:56,0:09:58,SPEAKER 4, They all have a different shade. 
198,0:09:58,0:10:02,SPEAKER 2," All right, guys, doing my homework.  I have to say hello to 50 people today. "
199,0:10:02,0:10:10,SPEAKER 1, That's actually so embarrassing if you just see like the bottom  of the just chatting section or the Fortnite section.  And it's just like all the thumbnails are the same. 
200,0:10:10,0:10:12,SPEAKER 3," They give you the template, you guys.  Yeah. "
201,0:10:12,0:10:16,SPEAKER 2, They have like a Ninja master class like a watermark. 
202,0:10:16,0:10:18,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.  You have overlays. 
203,0:10:18,0:10:20,SPEAKER 2, Yeah.  The class comes with like an overlay pack. 
204,0:10:20,0:10:28,SPEAKER 3," If I'm leading this class,  I'd say put hashtag Ninja master class in your title.  View bot all of them. "
205,0:10:28,0:10:28,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
206,0:10:28,0:10:30,SPEAKER 3, Like 20 to 50.  Just nothing crazy. 
207,0:10:30,0:10:32,SPEAKER 1," Oh, okay, not a fuck. "
208,0:10:32,0:10:34,SPEAKER 3," No, no, no, no.  This one looks like you're good. "
209,0:10:34,0:10:34,SPEAKER 2, Looks like you're growing. 
210,0:10:34,0:10:38,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, and they're like, what the hell?  They tell their friends about it. "
211,0:10:38,0:10:42,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, no one really talks to my chat,  but I have a pretty active community.  Yeah, exclamation point discord for the discord. "
212,0:10:42,0:10:46,SPEAKER 3," I think we're so enthralled with my gameplay that they just don't talk.  But when they do, I say hi. "
213,0:10:46,0:10:54,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, because I've learned that.  Bots that try to have conversations with you  would be really funny for Twitch chat.  Do they have those?  I think they haven't been trained chat. "
214,0:10:54,0:11:00,SPEAKER 3," They haven't for comments, not for chat.  I mean, they have them from train chat to get fucking millions of dollars.  That's what I'm saying. "
215,0:11:00,0:11:04,SPEAKER 1," But they do exist because train chat, they'll like click on it  and be like, yeah, it's a fucking bot account. "
216,0:11:04,0:11:06,SPEAKER 4," Wait, does pay for that? "
217,0:11:06,0:11:14,SPEAKER 1," No.  No, no, no.  Dude, they're people that sit.  They have bot accounts that sit in train chat  because he does so many giveaways. "
218,0:11:14,0:11:14,SPEAKER 2, Oh. 
219,0:11:14,0:11:18,SPEAKER 4, I thought this was the gambling sponsor  trying to beef up the stream somehow. 
220,0:11:18,0:11:20,SPEAKER 1, No. 
221,0:11:20,0:11:30,SPEAKER 3," This is people, because he tweets out,  giving away $700,000 one day, fuck it.  And then you literally will have a good chance of getting like 5K  if you just are there in press enter.  A better chance than watching me. "
222,0:11:30,0:11:34,SPEAKER 1," Well, wait, why would you?  Yeah, why would you?  You know what I'm saying? "
223,0:11:34,0:11:42,SPEAKER 3," What's what I'm saying?  It's like, so you might as well watch him and do it in.  Like if you're gonna watch a stream  and you also have a chance of winning 700K,  train chat.  Sure, you're free. "
224,0:11:42,0:11:46,SPEAKER 2," I think it was just weird.  Yeah, you said a better chance to fly. "
225,0:11:46,0:11:48,SPEAKER 1, You also do this but have lower. 
226,0:11:48,0:11:50,SPEAKER 2, Are you trying to say that there's a random chance  you get 5K watching you? 
227,0:11:50,0:11:52,SPEAKER 3, Practice with me. 
228,0:11:52,0:11:52,SPEAKER 2, What? 
229,0:11:52,0:11:54,SPEAKER 4, They don't know about that. 
230,0:11:54,0:11:54,SPEAKER 3," Oh, you don't have a cracker? "
231,0:11:54,0:12:00,SPEAKER 2," Bro, he's right there.  Just by don't call him that.  Yeah, actually when you call Aiman, "
232,0:12:00,0:12:02,SPEAKER 1, that now it is a slur. 
233,0:12:02,0:12:02,SPEAKER 2, Yeah. 
234,0:12:02,0:12:04,SPEAKER 3, Can't take the board. 
235,0:12:04,0:12:06,SPEAKER 2, You look like the first guy they called that. 
236,0:12:06,0:12:10,SPEAKER 3, That's the cat's name. 
237,0:12:10,0:12:14,SPEAKER 1," No, it's not true.  Well, I did a marble and it won. "
238,0:12:14,0:12:14,SPEAKER 3," No, that's the marble that won. "
239,0:12:14,0:12:18,SPEAKER 2, And then it's a bad cat name. 
240,0:12:18,0:12:24,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, they're calling me reverse HP Lovecraft  because HP Lovecraft's name  was the Hard R cat. "
241,0:12:24,0:12:26,SPEAKER 1, That's his cat's name? 
242,0:12:26,0:12:30,SPEAKER 3," Hard R man.  Yeah, that was HP Lovecraft's cat's name. "
243,0:12:30,0:12:38,SPEAKER 1," That cannot be true.  If I have heard that HP Lovecraft was racist,  if this is the reason why that's unreasoned. "
244,0:12:38,0:12:40,SPEAKER 3," I don't think this is the reason why I think this shows.  No, no, it's the reason why people know that. "
245,0:12:40,0:12:42,SPEAKER 1," Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Something about it being dude, "
246,0:12:42,0:12:46,SPEAKER 4," it being man right after.  Yeah, what? "
247,0:12:46,0:12:46,SPEAKER 1," Oh, it just says it. "
248,0:12:46,0:12:48,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, that's Christ. "
249,0:12:48,0:12:48,SPEAKER 1," I mean, it's Google. "
250,0:12:48,0:12:50,SPEAKER 3, They're not scared. 
251,0:12:50,0:12:50,SPEAKER 1," Oh, my God. "
252,0:12:50,0:12:54,SPEAKER 4, We got to stop saying kitty man.  Kitty man's done. 
253,0:12:54,0:12:56,SPEAKER 2," No, that's crazy to call your cat. "
254,0:12:56,0:13:02,SPEAKER 3," So anyway, say hello to cracker man.  Kitty man. "
255,0:13:02,0:13:04,SPEAKER 1, I liked it.  If you liked Kitty man. 
256,0:13:04,0:13:04,SPEAKER 2, If you like it. 
257,0:13:04,0:13:06,SPEAKER 3, I don't love it. 
258,0:13:06,0:13:08,SPEAKER 2, You're gonna love what we have next.  Yeah. 
259,0:13:08,0:13:20,SPEAKER 1," My first suggestion was potato like weeks ago.  Right.  And cutie in the chat was like, I like that.  And I'm like, no, don't name it fucking potato. "
260,0:13:20,0:13:24,SPEAKER 3, You said it's bad that you shouldn't be in weird potato. 
261,0:13:24,0:13:26,SPEAKER 1, But she thought it was cute.  It is cute. 
262,0:13:26,0:13:28,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, the other name and contention is amen. "
263,0:13:28,0:13:32,SPEAKER 2," Uh, I don't like amen because it'll be confusing.  Yeah. "
264,0:13:32,0:13:36,SPEAKER 1," It's like having like, you know, it would be like having three people "
265,0:13:36,0:13:40,SPEAKER 4, at our company with the same name and like that. 
266,0:13:40,0:13:46,SPEAKER 1," Well, that's what God wanted.  This is what we can choose.  We're the God to the cat.  I want to be God and name things out. "
267,0:13:46,0:13:50,SPEAKER 4, God and name things after me in my image. 
268,0:13:50,0:13:54,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, but if things that aren't yours, everything is mine because I'm God. "
269,0:13:54,0:13:56,SPEAKER 3, Okay.  That's actually fair. 
270,0:13:56,0:14:04,SPEAKER 1," He's omnipresent.  But if you tried to take this cat away,  a lot of it would break your neck.  And I don't think you can break God's neck. "
271,0:14:04,0:14:04,SPEAKER 4, It's a good point. 
272,0:14:04,0:14:06,SPEAKER 1," My neck, if you tried it wouldn't snap. "
273,0:14:06,0:14:08,SPEAKER 3, I want to do it.  Yeah. 
274,0:14:08,0:14:10,SPEAKER 1, He's really texting me. 
275,0:14:10,0:14:10,SPEAKER 3, I love you a lot. 
276,0:14:10,0:14:12,SPEAKER 1, So I won't.  But boy. 
277,0:14:12,0:14:14,SPEAKER 3, That's how you get your neck. 
278,0:14:14,0:14:14,SPEAKER 2, If I could get it rewind. 
279,0:14:14,0:14:16,SPEAKER 3, Just to try it out. 
280,0:14:16,0:14:16,SPEAKER 1, I'll do it. 
281,0:14:16,0:14:18,SPEAKER 3, My name is Coots.  Coots? 
282,0:14:18,0:14:20,SPEAKER 1, Coots is good. 
283,0:14:20,0:14:28,SPEAKER 2," I like it because it's similar to boots,  which people call their cats that have little stalk,  whatever, but it doesn't have that.  So it's like Coots.  It's different. "
284,0:14:28,0:14:30,SPEAKER 3, Chats name is Marbles. 
285,0:14:30,0:14:32,SPEAKER 2, No. 
286,0:14:32,0:14:34,SPEAKER 1," Oh, that's kind of cute.  I like that. "
287,0:14:34,0:14:34,SPEAKER 3, Overwhelmingly. 
288,0:14:34,0:14:40,SPEAKER 2, I don't like it because it's just what they were looking at when they said it.  Yes.  It's like Ludwig.  I like it. 
289,0:14:40,0:14:44,SPEAKER 4, You know what else would be good?  No. 
290,0:14:44,0:14:48,SPEAKER 1," No, actually.  That's what we call the Keemstar.  Not at all. "
291,0:14:48,0:14:48,SPEAKER 3, Maybe it's just called a Keemstar. 
292,0:14:48,0:14:50,SPEAKER 2, I do. 
293,0:14:50,0:14:54,SPEAKER 1, I'm down.  Let's take it back.  Let's throw it against the wall.  Let's take it back.  It's a fun fight. 
294,0:14:54,0:14:58,SPEAKER 3," No, I was like, it's empowering because we'll take back Keemstar. "
295,0:14:58,0:15:00,SPEAKER 1," No, no, his fucking word doesn't have any values.  Throw it against the wall. "
296,0:15:00,0:15:02,SPEAKER 3, Yeah. 
297,0:15:02,0:15:02,SPEAKER 1, I'm getting it going. 
298,0:15:02,0:15:06,SPEAKER 3, It's like a candle.  I love that because he's cute.  Jesus Christ. 
299,0:15:06,0:15:06,SPEAKER 1, He's right there. 
300,0:15:06,0:15:08,SPEAKER 3, He can hear you. 
301,0:15:08,0:15:10,SPEAKER 4, He's trying to climb out. 
302,0:15:10,0:15:10,SPEAKER 1, She's not Keemstar. 
303,0:15:10,0:15:12,SPEAKER 3, She is cute. 
304,0:15:12,0:15:14,SPEAKER 1, He's the Keemstar. 
305,0:15:14,0:15:20,SPEAKER 4," You have a bad precedent because Durs is a girl, but we all collectively say he. "
306,0:15:20,0:15:22,SPEAKER 1, Is that leakable? 
307,0:15:22,0:15:24,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, it's leakable.  Oh, God.  You talked about this. "
308,0:15:24,0:15:26,SPEAKER 1, I didn't know a street knowledge. 
309,0:15:26,0:15:32,SPEAKER 3, Yeah.  It's also like chill.  Like what's Durs?  Who's gonna be like Durs seriously? 
310,0:15:32,0:15:34,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, wait.  It won't be the danger of that. "
311,0:15:34,0:15:34,SPEAKER 1, I just think it. 
312,0:15:34,0:15:36,SPEAKER 3, You're not. 
313,0:15:36,0:15:38,SPEAKER 1, I genuinely don't.  I think we should ask Durs before we do something like that. 
314,0:15:38,0:15:40,SPEAKER 2, Yeah.  That's fair enough. 
315,0:15:40,0:15:42,SPEAKER 3," We're not not talking to Durs, Matt.  Because it's good. "
316,0:15:42,0:15:48,SPEAKER 1, Durs is so fucking mad all the time now.  He's just kind of hangs out in weird spots that he doesn't hang out in anymore. 
317,0:15:48,0:15:56,SPEAKER 2," I didn't realize cats get like that.  I thought like when a cat's older than like a baby-ass cat asked, it would just kind of be like,  all right, well, I'm your fucking dad now. "
318,0:15:56,0:15:58,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
319,0:15:58,0:16:02,SPEAKER 2, And so this is how this goes.  And I'm gonna meow at you when you're near my food and you're not gonna eat it anymore.  But we're chill. 
320,0:16:02,0:16:06,SPEAKER 3," I think Durs is like three or four though.  So Durs is like, I'm still baby. "
321,0:16:06,0:16:10,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, but in cat ears, that's like what?  Like four million or like whatever. "
322,0:16:10,0:16:12,SPEAKER 3, I don't think there's a lot for audio people. 
323,0:16:12,0:16:28,SPEAKER 4," We have this, we have this carrier in front of us, right?  That's what the cat is in right now.  And cutie was just having new cat hanging out in the carrier downstairs last night.  And Durs straight up just climbs into the carrier and eats all of his food no way. "
324,0:16:28,0:16:28,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
325,0:16:28,0:16:30,SPEAKER 2, It's so money.  It was pretty alpha. 
326,0:16:30,0:16:32,SPEAKER 3, Nick has some insane pictures. 
327,0:16:32,0:16:40,SPEAKER 2," Oh, dude.  I'm gonna, I'll get this over to zipper.  I took this insane.  Oh, I can put it.  Well, it would just be like a 10 second clip.  Sure.  Without any audio, but. "
328,0:16:40,0:16:44,SPEAKER 1, You know what you do?  We record a voiceover like Wombo combo or something like hype while he's doing it. 
329,0:16:44,0:16:46,SPEAKER 3, Like what is stealing the food? 
330,0:16:46,0:16:54,SPEAKER 2," Yeah.  Dude, it's actually the picture.  The picture is like a painting.  It's beautiful.  I'm gonna send it to zipper. "
331,0:16:54,0:17:00,SPEAKER 1," I was a man.  I was thinking.  Oh, what is it?  He just meowed it down.  He's a damn meow in the world. "
332,0:17:00,0:17:02,SPEAKER 2, I wish they could hear that. 
333,0:17:02,0:17:04,SPEAKER 4, She barely does that too.  She's pretty quiet mostly.  Cats are good at it. 
334,0:17:04,0:17:08,SPEAKER 3, I figure I should have gotten this fucking years ago.  We're like crap.  It's crap. 
335,0:17:08,0:17:10,SPEAKER 2, It's crap. 
336,0:17:10,0:17:12,SPEAKER 4, You were the only person who is against this the whole time.  I was against it. 
337,0:17:12,0:17:16,SPEAKER 3," In the moment it came out, turns out cats are great for content. "
338,0:17:16,0:17:32,SPEAKER 1," This is why I can't fucking trust what you use.  Which is annoying.  Every time I go to Ludwig, it's like about content or it's about like YouTube or something.  And it's like he is the authority.  He knows so much.  But you ask him something.  He's like, I don't know.  I was like, why is this person not as successful?  He's like, I don't know. "
339,0:17:32,0:17:34,SPEAKER 2, I think it's a good thing to say. 
340,0:17:34,0:17:34,SPEAKER 3, I don't know. 
341,0:17:34,0:17:52,SPEAKER 1," But also you'll say something definitively.  And you'll be like, Ludwig, I think this is a good idea.  No, that's stupid.  And then you'll see someone else do it.  And you'll be like, yeah, it's Pog, we need to do that.  And it's so fucking annoying.  Yeah.  Oh my God.  That is so funny. "
342,0:17:52,0:18:08,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, this is like one of the most beautiful photos.  Oh my God.  They sound potato.  They sat like, you know how long it takes the cat to eat like a whole bowl of food.  Yeah.  But they eat so little.  They sat like that the entire time.  And I filmed the entire two and a half minutes. "
343,0:18:08,0:18:08,SPEAKER 3, Shoots is watching the whole time. 
344,0:18:08,0:18:10,SPEAKER 1, That's so funny. 
345,0:18:10,0:18:16,SPEAKER 2, Maybe it's a funny intro if I just speed it up.  And it's two and a half minutes and ten seconds.  It's just all the food. 
346,0:18:16,0:18:16,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
347,0:18:16,0:18:18,SPEAKER 2, That'd be good.  Yeah. 
348,0:18:18,0:18:22,SPEAKER 3, Like I make my grab noises.  We get directors commentary from doors. 
349,0:18:22,0:18:22,SPEAKER 2, Oh man. 
350,0:18:22,0:18:32,SPEAKER 3, Yeah.  I just found out that it's broke.  I didn't realize how good it would be.  Like I knew Schlatt had a cat who was good for content.  But I was sitting at 28K viewers today playing marbles just picking a cat name. 
351,0:18:32,0:18:32,SPEAKER 1, For cat. 
352,0:18:32,0:18:38,SPEAKER 3, For cat.  For like four hours.  And then I posted a tweet with picture of cat.  50K likes. 
353,0:18:38,0:18:46,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.  I posted just now on the yard Twitter audio listeners are going to be pissed.  And it's popping off.  And it's just the cat.  Thousand likes already. 
354,0:18:46,0:18:50,SPEAKER 2, You're like a guy in 2008.  Like dude pictures of cats are doing so good.  Yeah. 
355,0:18:50,0:18:54,SPEAKER 3, I thought it was done.  I thought it was done.  Like I thought that was like. 
356,0:18:54,0:19:00,SPEAKER 1, They like talked.  But we like swapped the S's for Z's.  They're like stupid sounding.  Because they're like L again.  But we make them look stupid. 
357,0:19:00,0:19:02,SPEAKER 3, They're like Borgers. 
358,0:19:02,0:19:08,SPEAKER 1," Yes.  You actually are just like me.  Because you'll have such a veyment opinion of something.  And then you'll experience it.  And you'll be like, ah, I was wrong. "
359,0:19:08,0:19:12,SPEAKER 3," Well, I didn't want the cat because I didn't want a fucking cat. "
360,0:19:12,0:19:12,SPEAKER 1, And that is true. 
361,0:19:12,0:19:16,SPEAKER 3, And also my valid concern to one was that the cat would love you guys. 
362,0:19:16,0:19:18,SPEAKER 1, Right. 
363,0:19:18,0:19:18,SPEAKER 3," Which, don't want that. "
364,0:19:18,0:19:20,SPEAKER 2, Why not? 
365,0:19:20,0:19:20,SPEAKER 3, Because I want to tell of me. 
366,0:19:20,0:19:22,SPEAKER 2, You don't think it's possible of doing both. 
367,0:19:22,0:19:24,SPEAKER 1, No. 
368,0:19:24,0:19:26,SPEAKER 3," Why do you, there's such a word?  It's too charming. "
369,0:19:26,0:19:28,SPEAKER 1," Dude, Durs hates Aiden now.  And we hate him now too because of the hair. "
370,0:19:28,0:19:32,SPEAKER 2, Were you not afraid when you started this podcast  that all your fans would love us instead of you? 
371,0:19:32,0:19:34,SPEAKER 1," No.  Oh, you were confident, huh? "
372,0:19:34,0:19:40,SPEAKER 3," I'm okay with they love you.  But I want the cats to love me.  Like if they all love you and don't love me,  I'm like whatever, I'm down. "
373,0:19:40,0:19:44,SPEAKER 1, So a trolley problem.  It's the cat.  And then all one million of your fans. 
374,0:19:44,0:19:44,SPEAKER 2, Yeah. 
375,0:19:44,0:19:48,SPEAKER 1, And the troll just fucking flies through them all.

377,0:19:50,0:19:52,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.  I'm down.  It's a good train. 
378,0:19:52,0:19:54,SPEAKER 2, It's a good story. 
379,0:19:54,0:19:58,SPEAKER 3, But if I'm lying down watching anime deaths  in the cat is on Aiman and not me.  I'm necking myself next day. 
380,0:19:58,0:20:00,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.  Uh-huh.

384,0:20:04,0:20:06,SPEAKER 1, It should be two. 
385,0:20:06,0:20:08,SPEAKER 3, The problem two I had was that Durs would be said. 
386,0:20:08,0:20:10,SPEAKER 1, Why? 
387,0:20:10,0:20:10,SPEAKER 2, Fuck Durs. 
388,0:20:10,0:20:12,SPEAKER 1," Oh, see? "

390,0:20:12,0:20:20,SPEAKER 1," Durs is sad.  No.  That is happening.  Yeah, but he's being annoying.  So it's like he's being sad in the same way  like Aiman's sad when you, you know,  telling me can't fucking get there. "
391,0:20:20,0:20:22,SPEAKER 2, Wow. 
392,0:20:22,0:20:22,SPEAKER 3, Three women in one night.

410,0:21:33,0:21:41,SPEAKER 1," Right, it's like you're just along for the ride  But when you're with your family, it's like it's the whole iceberg of like every time you're like you're parents "

413,0:21:56,0:22:04,SPEAKER 1, That's a Brazilian. Let's try to think. Yeah  Took me so long. You shouldn't be wasting steaks on kids either. I hope they had some fun 
414,0:22:04,0:22:38,SPEAKER 3," What happened is we sat down  They shouldn't be wasting these kids. I'm just saying so fucking I fucking within 30 seconds  They decided they were leaving  The all the parents because the kids were all crying  They're like I can eat it and like you just don't want to deal that and it's annoying to everyone else  Like all right, we're just gonna fucking go kid who's losing it.

425,0:23:37,0:23:43,SPEAKER 3," Johnson. Yeah, so I like hanging out of them cool, but I feel like I there's not a group of people "

You're slim. I got horses. I got slim shady pants  I don't know I remember we should all have one kid and then we should all train our kid to fight the other ones  We should tell them that there's three other kids that are hunting  So they don't have a concept of life because they're born and they're under our control  That's right. We homeschool all of our kids and we tell all of them. There's three kids out there who are looking for you  In the world and when they find you, they're going to fucking kill you "
447,0:26:34,0:26:37,SPEAKER 1, It's like the one thing that you base their whole life around yeah 
448,0:26:37,0:26:42,SPEAKER 3," You're not on one day and a kid ding dong ditches that your child will kill that child. No, no, no "
449,0:26:42,0:27:00,SPEAKER 2," Well, we'll give pictures. We'll share pictures with each other  I'll be like this is what those kids look like and then when they turn 18  We're gonna we're gonna arrange them to all meet in a park.

451,0:27:03,0:27:05,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, winner "
452,0:27:05,0:27:08,SPEAKER 3," At 18 and then you tell the winner. Oh, we were just kidding. No, because you're homeschooling "
453,0:27:17,0:27:19,SPEAKER 1," Fuckers, you're crazy they can't like read "
454,0:27:24,0:27:43,SPEAKER 3," They can fight like a machine we should all teach them different training methods like jujitsu karate  And then and then it's like which in the YouTube videos which fighting styles the best. Oh, but then you get in it  It's like we train four children for 18 years. They cannot read writer speak languages  But they are jujitsu karate "
455,0:27:43,0:27:45,SPEAKER 2, You tell a little children who are fucking weapons 
456,0:27:48,0:27:51,SPEAKER 1, It's like Spongebob. It's like forget everything except breathing and fine-dining 
457,0:27:52,0:28:05,SPEAKER 2, But it's breathing in hand-to-hand combat if you look anything like any of these children stay inside  Because you do zealots because I would create people who actually have to be worried about kids who look like that looking for them 
458,0:28:05,0:28:11,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, yeah  Also, it create like a culture of like yeah, I'm hard. I I dressed up like kid number two "
459,0:28:11,0:28:19,SPEAKER 3," I don't fucking care. Yeah, they would go by numbers. We lock our kids inside on Halloween  So they don't go on a purge because they're all master "
460,0:28:20,0:28:22,SPEAKER 1, Maybe your girlfriend's family's at worst 
461,0:28:23,0:28:25,SPEAKER 3, Yeah 
462,0:28:25,0:28:27,SPEAKER 4, Think of those kids do anything 
463,0:28:27,0:28:44,SPEAKER 3," I hear my secret plot with that with those gaggle kids. Oh, I put them all in big battle bus  And drop them out of the sky and then make fortnight put in real life get close enough that they love me to babysit them  Okay, and then do old enough  With just those kid us "
464,0:28:45,0:28:47,SPEAKER 1," She's like, why don't you do that "
465,0:28:48,0:28:54,SPEAKER 4," Do it y'all have met up here doing old enough, but just in Los Angeles in the middle of the night. Yeah "
466,0:28:55,0:28:59,SPEAKER 3," I went to Detroit, Michigan at 3 a.m. I said my kids are the casino "
467,0:29:00,0:29:03,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, no, yeah, we all tried to operate a white castle together. Yeah "
468,0:29:04,0:29:06,SPEAKER 3, And that's what I want to send them on little American missions 
469,0:29:06,0:29:15,SPEAKER 1," You think it'd be publicized for what like other audiences  Because like you the fun part about old enough is that they're like Japanese kids and it's different culture, right? "
470,0:29:16,0:29:22,SPEAKER 3, I think it'd be really fun to see it in America because I think the moment you see old enough  He go we couldn't do that we couldn't do that 
471,0:29:22,0:29:47,SPEAKER 4," I couldn't send my kid to level 11. Yeah, the sort of the reverse version of this is there's this YouTube video from this Korean guy  And he makes like little just little like documentary sort of type content and  He goes to stocked in and hangs out with a bunch of gangs  But like films it from like the perspective of like a Korean guy who doesn't know anything about like this sort of culture  And "
472,0:29:47,0:29:49,SPEAKER 1, Battle wrapping at the end 
473,0:29:49,0:30:14,SPEAKER 4," Like I name dumbfounded like people's yards and like they shoved their fucking guns and shit  And the whole thing is subtitled in Korean  That's sick. Yeah, it's like a really dope video because it's it's just like it's I feel like it's the whole content of the video  like wouldn't be that exciting from like our perspective  But apparently like to the average like Korean citizen. It's like holy shit. What is going on? It's not that's what LA is like  Yeah, that's that's our that's our "
474,0:30:15,0:30:17,SPEAKER 3, That's our 
475,0:30:17,0:30:34,SPEAKER 2," The way we like when you say it, Ludwig. Yeah, I went to a watch the video today from um this this  YouTuber from England. Fuck what's his name, Ludwig? He's Niko something. Niko. Oh, it was the that one who he's  No, I just watched this video. He goes to Arkansas, right? Yeah, so he went he he's a black guy "
476,0:30:34,0:30:38,SPEAKER 3, And he goes to the most racist town in Alabama. Oh the guy who ran for mayor. I don't know his name 
477,0:30:38,0:30:41,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, yeah, this guy's racist town in Arkansas "
478,0:30:41,0:30:46,SPEAKER 3, His videos fucking slide. He's a viral video really fucking good. He does not stop making viral. I watch the whole video 
479,0:30:46,0:30:52,SPEAKER 2, He just goes to the most what's you know what he found the most racist town in Alabama and everyone there is super nice and chill 
480,0:30:53,0:30:56,SPEAKER 4," You keep saying Alabama in Texas. Oh wait, it's Arkansas. I just "
481,0:30:57,0:31:00,SPEAKER 2," Might be all right, so they're in Alabama and "
482,0:31:01,0:31:02,SPEAKER 1, Deep red swamps 
483,0:31:02,0:31:31,SPEAKER 2," Wait, everyone's really nice to him. So everyone's really cool and chill and no one there's racist and they're like yeah  I don't think should racist because like the the X KKK leader isn't let the town over  But like we're all like not racist and he's like oh cool. So then he goes and interviews the KKK leader and he's like oh yeah, I'm racist  I'm a right. He's like  And he's like he like he's just they like he just fucking with them but the interview is him fucking with them  Yeah, yeah, he's his name is Imar Nance and he's like oh, I'm with Imar Nance and the guy he doesn't know the word Nance "
484,0:31:31,0:31:38,SPEAKER 4," He calls him to schedule the interview and he just said like he's a British guy, right?  And he just says he's with the BBC, but it's like for his YouTube "
485,0:31:38,0:32:06,SPEAKER 2," And I love that he says he's with the BBC  He says he's a really big fan and he wants to prove the KKK is not racist  And that's the point of the interview and so it did so easy the guy in the video  He's like so he's saying this thing. He's like not so like I think people like don't understand like like I have  I have as much sympathy is like if like a black a black kid was killed and he thinks for a moment  He's like well no, I'd have more sympathy for a white kid  I want to pay that clear. That's insane. Yeah, yeah, he's just like like ultra racist "
486,0:32:06,0:32:09,SPEAKER 1, It has come out like recently. I think so I think two days ago. It was in my 
487,0:32:09,0:32:16,SPEAKER 4, My timing. He's like the rhetorical back in the manifesto dude where he asks himself if he's a white supremacist 
488,0:32:16,0:32:22,SPEAKER 1," And he's like yeah, yeah, yeah, it's just like  Psychopathic and then and then like the media is like yeah, we're not sure "
489,0:32:23,0:32:27,SPEAKER 4, We don't know it's an investigation whether it's a hate crime or not 
490,0:32:27,0:32:28,SPEAKER 1, So insane 
491,0:32:28,0:32:52,SPEAKER 4," The so is it jidian or jidian jidian? Okay, so jidian made a video like a week ago in the same town  And the reason they're all going there is because of like a viral video from like over a year ago  Where this guy from out of town like decides to stay in on the side of the road and at stores in that town  With like a sign that just says black lives matter. Yeah, so he doesn't say anything  And he just like lets people come by and like basically yell at him. This is a white guy, right? "
492,0:32:52,0:32:55,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, and everyone comes up and it's like I'm gonna fucking kill you tonight "
493,0:32:55,0:33:09,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, and they don't need a super that people the things people say to him are are fucked up  So there's this like string of videos from other youtubers that go to this town after to see if it's like really the most racist town in America  Like that's the context "
494,0:33:09,0:33:15,SPEAKER 1, Stabilating this tiny little town's economy and by like you know having like racial racist tourism 
495,0:33:16,0:33:28,SPEAKER 2, To go there we should go to that town in Arkansas with like a black live matter sign  But it's one of those cool big arrows and we do like the spinning around on this on the corner  We do what's cool tricks. They'll be able to read they're like they're like I don't like what he's doing 
496,0:33:28,0:33:33,SPEAKER 1," But it looks pretty cool, but there's a big arrow pointing over to that piece of place. Well, he's he's surfing on "
497,0:33:34,0:33:36,SPEAKER 2, Right no water over there 
498,0:33:37,0:33:43,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, that's true. They'd be like I don't know what it says, but  Jeannie wouldn't spend it "
499,0:33:43,0:33:57,SPEAKER 4, Jeannie and made like the same type of video type of videos this Nico guy basically like exploring the town and like talking to people there  And like the general takeaways that like the average person there is like not a piece of shit  Like that's like they're they're taking away a sample size 
500,0:33:57,0:34:01,SPEAKER 1, But that's also like you don't know he might go home and find out what their fucking cat's name is 
501,0:34:01,0:34:03,SPEAKER 3," Did you know it was a little too much like nobody's racist here. Yeah, yeah "
502,0:34:04,0:34:27,SPEAKER 4," It was like it's like I'm pretty sure there's no racist in this town like it or like the town's all right  I talked like you've talked like 20 people man.

546,0:41:22,0:41:39,SPEAKER 4, I had a I had an issue recently where where I think somebody was a spoofing  My number to call like to mask all people and for a whole day  I got calls and voicemails back from businesses that were like looking looking to get back in contact with me 
547,0:41:39,0:41:41,SPEAKER 2, I forgot about this. Yeah. It's so funny 
548,0:41:41,0:41:55,SPEAKER 4," Dude, I it was so  No, it's some luck because some people would keep calling some people  I'm like, why is this person calling back for the fourth time and I'd pick up and I'm like and they're like  Hey, you got to stop calling my business like if you want something like just just stop "
549,0:41:55,0:42:19,SPEAKER 2," Stop giving us calls and I'm like, I don't know what to tell you. It's calling people back on an individual level and explaining what's going on  It is it was one of the funniest things ever. He's calling people. He's like, okay, so what I think what's happening  Is I think someone is spoofing my number to call and so it wasn't me who called you  So I understand that like you're upset, but like I wasn't I'm literally driving and I'm like  It's sociopath. You're doing this in the car. Yeah "
550,0:42:19,0:42:21,SPEAKER 4, I'm in the car with him. We're on the way back from

552,0:42:27,0:42:31,SPEAKER 4, Why is that why is that the difference to you? It's funny because like you 
553,0:42:31,0:42:37,SPEAKER 2, This is just happening to you and telling one person what's going on is going to do no damage 
554,0:42:37,0:42:44,SPEAKER 4," No, it was because some people kept calling me  It's like one dude called me back maybe four times and I can see that it's the same "
555,0:42:47,0:42:53,SPEAKER 2, But you said you explain all the situations then it's like I'm pranking him because I have clearly 
556,0:42:53,0:42:56,SPEAKER 4," I have clearly been calling I'm not just you know, I'm not pranking you "
557,0:42:57,0:43:02,SPEAKER 1," I don't even like pranks. Okay, my friend wanted you to ketamine on a podcast. It's a thing. It's on the internet "
558,0:43:03,0:43:06,SPEAKER 3, And maybe feel like a good business idea. We could actually work with it 
559,0:43:06,0:43:10,SPEAKER 2," I couldn't have called you. I was coming home from a smash chair. Okay, Juan. So I can't "
560,0:43:12,0:43:33,SPEAKER 1," Amen, what what the fuck why wouldn't you just  I feel like you can just  Not do all of that effort. I feel like you're in you just want to be right because listen no  I know I it's the same thing if you were like hey this video is really funny  And we all of those things were like I don't care if I'm getting owned I have to explain why I'm right "
561,0:43:34,0:43:39,SPEAKER 4," Oh, I feel like you're you're into you're clearly intentionally not listening to me "
562,0:43:39,0:43:55,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, wait. Yeah, I am. Oh, how's it feel by the way, but I am listening to you  Intentionally, I think it being the key word here.

563,0:43:55,0:44:00,SPEAKER 2, Some fucking dumbass wrote a whole reddit post explaining why oh that was insane. I read it 
564,0:44:00,0:44:20,SPEAKER 1," I was just like down one sentence in this is already wrong someone someone on the patreon commented  I wish slime with quit directing the conversation and I was like imagine paying to write this comment  But but what I'm saying is let's just all go back to it  Go finish finish your reasoning because we didn't let you do that. Okay, so somebody is spoofing my number to call "
565,0:44:21,0:44:45,SPEAKER 4, Clearly a mass amount of numbers and I'd be spam getting phone calls from different people in the same  geographical area all day most of these people only call back once some of them leave a voicemail  But some people keep calling me back over and over and over again  So these are like disgruntled customers disgruntled businesses that have clearly been like spam called by my number 
566,0:44:45,0:44:50,SPEAKER 1, You said you were gonna clean all the calm off our walls in the business and there's calm every 
567,0:44:51,0:44:57,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, it would have been funny if you just answered was like hey  And they're like why are you calling? It's like I just want to talk "
568,0:44:57,0:45:02,SPEAKER 4," Why are you answering that's what I did the first time somebody called me okay? No, no, I'm saying "
569,0:45:02,0:45:05,SPEAKER 2, Print you're having a real conversation basically like okay 
570,0:45:05,0:45:13,SPEAKER 1," How about you explain the problem again? And they're like oh, there's just fucking come everywhere  We said come removal services and they still come and you're like well the reason why we couldn't get out there days because the truck is like "
571,0:45:13,0:45:31,SPEAKER 4," You know one no gas and truck and they would all sit they all were like very like mundane businesses like it was like  plumbers and like moving services and things like that heroes  So I did I did not capitalize on the opportunity to give them a fake you know a fake business opportunity, but I can't do that "

621,0:52:48,0:52:51,SPEAKER 3," No, it was a great fight like five rounds if it's a good fight "
622,0:52:51,0:53:02,SPEAKER 2," It's but he went five rounds and he fucking the other guy's face was fucked up, too  Like yeah, but he just lost but like it was a good fight  I thought it was a perfect event the only thing that made it better is one person getting knocked out because no one got knocked out "
623,0:53:03,0:53:07,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, it was all TKOs. Yeah, yeah, because I don't think I think if it they might have uh "
624,0:53:07,0:53:25,SPEAKER 2," I think they were calling it early because of how amateur the fights were like they were calling Ted and Klonaka  I think close or earlier than they normally would yeah 12 rounds is too much for like a  No, like in rounds. I mean like like Matt Watson for example out the gate is he lost in like under a minute  Like he literally gets pulled over. Oh, and they're like there's no coming back and they and he didn't fall or anything "
625,0:53:25,0:53:28,SPEAKER 3, The rep is like you cannot I have to end this fight for your safety 
626,0:53:28,0:53:38,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, the rep was just like TKO it's over. Yeah, okay, and I think in a like a real amateur boxing event  They probably would let them keep going until it's like they would have I don't know he was getting to shit push it "
627,0:53:38,0:53:58,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, maybe every TV that Watson's a bad example. It looked bad the TKOs. He was like, okay  If this kept going like like uh, there's the Australian. I did a thing. Oh my god. Did he at one point?  He's like he's fucking up the other guy. He's fighting right he's fighting the odd one out the fucking huge youtuber  You see in target when you go to the board game section like he does animation youtuber and dude "
628,0:53:58,0:54:06,SPEAKER 2, How does what happens to the fight he's literally the Australian guy just fucking him up and then he he  Turns to the ref and says and the fight. That's funny and then keeps punching him 
629,0:54:06,0:54:25,SPEAKER 3," It was so funny and then he turns after a couple more punches  Like and the fight and the fight and the fight and it's punching the ref and the fight  He's like both you'll talk you go. It was the biggest mismatch. Dude, he fought in khakis  Money he was the only person not wearing boxing shorts. He was six three Australian ripped the other guy was like five ten "
630,0:54:25,0:54:30,SPEAKER 1," American had started working out in the past like 18 months. Dude, is it only weight class for fighting and stuff? "
631,0:54:30,0:54:35,SPEAKER 3," The weight classes don't really matter in show matches. None of them were like correct. I mean, but it does because like no "
632,0:54:35,0:54:39,SPEAKER 2," They they had weight classes. Yeah, they made people come down or go up "
633,0:54:39,0:54:56,SPEAKER 3," They didn't actually like minks had I think eight pounds and she was supposed to be even with a person choose fighting  I thought I wasn't a certain a certain range. They were supposed to both be 150  So I think I think they both agreed on a number for probably every fight, but none of them probably hit high CS. Yeah, how long was he that?  Rehours dude "
634,0:54:56,0:55:24,SPEAKER 2," Dude minks this fight was so funny because uh, so the other girl Haley sharp. I think it's her name  um  She looked really good like she like she looked like she trained really hard and like learned a lot about boxing was and looked technically like a really good fighter  But no matter what punch hit minks minks was just a wall  Yeah, minks would just take a punch and then just be like all right  And then just keep punching her back, but when but minks hit with like like bigger damage  Minks had like a like a like she wound her fists like this and hit her and it was like "
635,0:55:25,0:55:28,SPEAKER 1," Did she she won? Yeah, she won. Yeah, yeah, yeah, they're just not enough stagger "
636,0:55:29,0:55:31,SPEAKER 3, It was one of those dolls that you hit and then it just goes right back 
637,0:55:32,0:55:46,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, she like wabba fat. Yeah  That's yeah, that's that Irish rage. They were all they were all tied. It's fun every I think every single fight was good  There's some that were like less good uh, like that get the heavyweight fight or what was that? Yeah, so it was a um "
638,0:55:46,0:55:52,SPEAKER 1," It was like uh, what do you call it paper view, right? Yes, and it was probably like restreamed somewhere else "
639,0:55:52,0:56:21,SPEAKER 3," It was  Thousand viewers on a twitch stream because when you go to buy it because we had one key and you can't use it on multiple computers  And I had to go downstairs because of recording something and when I went to buy it  It said you can watch the replay when it's done and I was like that's cringe  I want to watch a live didn't realize that it would have worked  And so I go to twitch and I'm browsing and I see a guy with like 50 viewers  I click it and he's watching the fight and then by the end of the fight is two thousand viewers  Yeah, it was like the fall notification. That's like bring with the green thing in the lane going middle the screen "
640,0:56:22,0:56:29,SPEAKER 1," He's like green screen imagine it's like yeah, really  I really broke out in twitch when I restreamed the mince fight  Yeah, I was just ripping bombs "
641,0:56:29,0:57:27,SPEAKER 2," Platform that hosted the event that they're like a streaming platform that uh, like is just less developed than twitch or youtube  So they just had unmoderated chat and they're literally the entire event  There's people posting the n-word like like copy-pasting like huge walls of the n-word god and somehow making their like your profile picture  If you don't have one is just text but they somehow made it a swatzika  And then they're just posting the n-word the whole event so like I think their moderation is this like a platform  They were like manually that they have employees manually making moderation instead of making chat moderators  I don't know if they have the like the the system built on and so the people and chat  It's like a machine-learned program. It's like trying to learn to be more a better racist  It's just getting better at changing the n-word with symbols over time  So it started it was just like vanilla n-word and then by the end of it  It's like it's like three lines  And then the Syromoji and then like the unit code like other symbols and they were at a certain point  I was just less maddened. I was like they're getting creative "
642,0:57:29,0:57:40,SPEAKER 3," That's what I had to learn to do early streaming because you put in the band list of words  So I just typed in the n-word as many ways as I could think of  Really, I didn't you did that. I had to do this to stop the n-word "
643,0:57:40,0:57:44,SPEAKER 1, Uh-oh to stop it. I was to stop it. It was to stop it. It was to stop it. Because you were right 
644,0:57:45,0:57:56,SPEAKER 3," It's kind of sounds like you don't have to type out the slur it doesn't it's not like you want to stop slurs and then you click check mark  Yes, I would you have to say what words would you like to have banned and you need to type in a slur? "
645,0:57:56,0:57:57,SPEAKER 1, Why didn't you have someone do it? 
646,0:57:57,0:58:02,SPEAKER 3," I would say what do you want me to do find someone who's black and say hey, could I ask you to do a job for me? "
647,0:58:03,0:58:07,SPEAKER 1, I feel like that's more that's better than you. That is way worse than you know 
648,0:58:07,0:58:11,SPEAKER 2, Is there any kind of like maybe certificate or like pass I could have? 
649,0:58:11,0:58:13,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, I'm ASC certified "
650,0:58:16,0:58:20,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, so you can uh, you can say it when it's in a song and you can type it into "
651,0:58:21,0:58:29,SPEAKER 1," moderation tools when you need to yeah, that's the one for a song. That's like years  Because that's a that you know, that's just for you. That's not for like doing something "
652,0:58:30,0:58:33,SPEAKER 3, Unless you're ninja unless you're ninja then you jump and all straight 
653,0:58:33,0:58:39,SPEAKER 1, You did that we still need to see it ninjas dick. We do need to see ninjas dick. We need to meet up with ninja somewhere 
654,0:58:39,0:58:47,SPEAKER 3," Looks like a smurf in Florida. I hope it's so hype if you had blue penis hair. Yeah, put all for you "
655,0:58:47,0:58:56,SPEAKER 1, If he knew his meeting up with you and he wanted to blow your mind and died it that'd be five  Be money that'd be cash and we did it too  Oh 
656,0:58:56,0:58:59,SPEAKER 3, We don't tell them we die our dick hair blow all blooming group 
657,0:58:59,0:59:02,SPEAKER 1," Yo, and then we start banging on little drums with them "
658,0:59:02,0:59:06,SPEAKER 3," We bring a little drums. Yeah, and tiny timpani drum right at blower nuts "
659,0:59:06,0:59:10,SPEAKER 1, And it's like got water in the room and the water pops up when they're banging our fucking winners middle school 
660,0:59:10,0:59:25,SPEAKER 3," A sign of being cool was the ability to thrust your hips and then clap your boy sack on your own ass cheek. Yeah  What was I can do that sign of being yeah, that's what the cool people would do  And I try to do it really hard, but I ended up just really hurting my nuts and almost getting to secular torsion "
661,0:59:26,0:59:29,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, it's a weird sound it makes because it's like "
662,0:59:29,0:59:35,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, my friend Michael in middle school was like really good right now. Yeah, I could do it  Probably the balls you mean right now "
663,0:59:38,0:59:40,SPEAKER 3, Go ahead king 
664,0:59:40,0:59:42,SPEAKER 1, What do you want me to get 
665,0:59:43,0:59:44,SPEAKER 2, He's protecting me 
666,0:59:44,0:59:46,SPEAKER 1, He said I can just get me 
667,0:59:50,1:00:06,SPEAKER 2," You want to see a fucking show  Cutie walks in I'm  We're just watching porn just get out  I haven't held the guy. Yeah, I love this is like the tonic "
668,1:00:06,1:00:11,SPEAKER 3, He's a cute guy  They do anything and it's cute 
669,1:00:11,1:00:19,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, that's fun. It's just in our brains to like this. Yeah, um  What happened? "
670,1:00:19,1:00:25,SPEAKER 2, He's looking my little thumb first licks forever  I want to be there for sure. I get first licks on the cat 
671,1:00:27,1:00:36,SPEAKER 1," Like you lick him. No, it's like greens right  You smoke the cat  I get first hit  with the kind of mean "
672,1:00:36,1:00:51,SPEAKER 4," Um, I'm a better understanding have cutie feels recently. Why? Because I had a dream about you  That was extremely negative and I woke up and I was mad at you. What?  What do you do this time? I was like dream all the way because back at it context "
673,1:00:51,1:01:00,SPEAKER 3, You've never been mad at me in the real world except for once where I maybe cut you off with a vest  But by accident I was mad when you did that and that's the only time you said you've ever been mad at me 
674,1:01:01,1:01:04,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, you almost killed me like real man. I see when you're mad at me "
675,1:01:04,1:01:13,SPEAKER 4, It's because crypto went down a bit  But you still like have a lot of money and when I'm mad at you  It's because you almost ran me into a boss and an intersection. I almost run you in a like I 
676,1:01:14,1:01:29,SPEAKER 1, It was a cool. It was like a close call. How fast are you going?  Force choosing hand grenades like 20 20 miles or could let me guess  Hmm 20 miles probably because I tried riding the his uh his mo pet and I was like this a little scary  I'm not ready for my goes way faster. It is scary 
677,1:01:29,1:01:33,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, the ones we have to be scary when somebody cuts you off when you're trying to make a turn "
678,1:01:33,1:01:35,SPEAKER 1, I'm trying to get into the mind of men. Yeah here 
679,1:01:35,1:01:42,SPEAKER 4, So imagine you're driving it and there's a car  And then someone makes you come to a complete stop 
680,1:01:42,1:01:43,SPEAKER 3, What was what was the dream? 
681,1:01:44,1:02:13,SPEAKER 4," Was the dream buddy in the dream in the dream where we're all going  On a vacation of some kind to like I and for some reason there's like it's not just us  It's like it's us and like 200 other people but everybody's like in on the trip  And we're waiting at the airport and I don't want to get on the plane right away  I want to wait until like the gate is almost close to to board  And we're going to this fucking uh  This this location in Mexico, and I can't remember the city um, but we're we're "
682,1:02:14,1:02:16,SPEAKER 1, going to Mexico 
683,1:02:16,1:02:19,SPEAKER 4, In the dream we're planning on going to Mexico. I did actually 
684,1:02:19,1:02:25,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, because you did so I got confused again  And I also kind of zoned out which is my fault and I apologize for that "
685,1:02:25,1:02:29,SPEAKER 4, That's and that's okay  And I'm not see how I'm not angry 
686,1:02:30,1:02:32,SPEAKER 3," Wow, you're a rational actor "
687,1:02:33,1:03:29,SPEAKER 4, and uh  But the plate the flight gets cancelled and you all come off the plane you you included you're organizing this trip  And uh you guys all get on the plane again  Flight cancels again. I've been waiting in the airport for ages and I'm kind of pissed that the flights keep getting cancelled  But I'm glad I'm not boarding quickly so I don't have to keep bringing my ship back and forth like you guys all do  Because everybody likes to board right away for for whatever reason  And finally  The uh I've been sitting alone like at the gate for a while because you guys boarded like the new the new flight  The new time to get on three take Jake and uh it's it there's a set time  I know when I had I need to get on the plane  But I realized like it's it's been like way way too long  And I go over to talk to the attendant at the gate and she's like oh they already left  I'm like what do you what do you mean? Like you can't leave before the time that you have listed  Like if you say that time tell your dad's why like you can't do this and then I'm like my dad my father 
688,1:03:29,1:03:38,SPEAKER 1, My mom would never let this happen. That's right. You hardly built it  He filled this plane with his bare fucking Canadian square hands. He he invented flying 
689,1:03:38,1:03:42,SPEAKER 3," Canadians have square hands you dumb bitch. Yeah, you wouldn't understand. Hold on. Let me eat some "
690,1:03:42,1:04:21,SPEAKER 4," That's why they can't turn the plane because their arms only go like this  But I find out that you have because the flights to the one city kept getting cancelled you have not only  Change the location of the trip  But you have paid the airline to leave early because you're so pissed about the cancellations  And you knew that I was waiting  But you didn't want to eat weight like the extra 10 minutes for me to get to the gate. Yeah, you are right  This is how I felt in the dream  And you had everybody take off without me and I don't get go on the trip anymore  And I'm just alone in the airport and because Ludwig didn't want to wait until the scheduled flight time "
691,1:04:21,1:04:24,SPEAKER 3, I am now on the trip. I stand by dream Ludwig 
692,1:04:25,1:04:29,SPEAKER 4, And then I wake up and I'm furious. I stand by dream Ludwig 
693,1:04:29,1:04:45,SPEAKER 3, I think dream Aiden was being inconsiderate by wanting to wait in the airport so we could sit in his seat for 10 extra minutes  One 200 of us. I agree. We're walking in and off and in and off and in into the plane  And I have to go my ass back out there to get you to come in because you want to sit for 10 extra minutes 
694,1:04:45,1:05:29,SPEAKER 1," Because maybe it gets cancelled because the time is listed. No, the time listed on the board time to own  Dream Aiden and real Aiden with a real story. You fucking blonde cocksucker. Here's why I was going to New York right last week  Okay, I asked Aiden earlier in the day. Can you take me to the airport? Okay, classic friend maneuver  You just take people to the airport it sucks and you do it for your friends. I've never said no to anyone ever  Aiman says, yeah, sure, I'll take you. Oh, okay. I believe him. He's Canadian. I'm okay with that  I know I know potato potato scratching around  He's like it happened. It's like and so Aiden asked me an hour before I asked to be driven there  Hey, can we just go now? That's not what I said "
695,1:05:30,1:05:33,SPEAKER 4, I said can do you mind if we leave early? That's a better phrasing 
696,1:05:34,1:05:45,SPEAKER 1," Do you mind if we leave early? Okay. Okay, and I say yeah  I don't want to spend an extra hour in the airport  And I was like why is like well, I'm just gonna be like I'm gonna be driving down to zipper zipper alphas "
697,1:05:45,1:05:50,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, I said I wanted to go to I said I was zipper alphas  I said I wanted to go to LA. Yeah "
698,1:05:51,1:06:09,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, it's like and I don't want to like and you but he was real pissy about it  He was like I just don't want to like you know, and then I go and then I got like got to go really late  And it's like and I was like well, what the fuck you're putting me in a spot where I literally have to say no  You said you would do this and now you have to wait so I just said no, just drive myself you put me in a spot where I couldn't say no "
699,1:06:09,1:06:39,SPEAKER 2," I need to clarify something  So is this how it went? Did you so you asked him for a ride? He said yes time goes by  He approaches you says can we go early at the time? He wants to go  He approaches me at like can we go early meaning like right now? Yes, so he's functionally says can we go now instead?  Which is fine. It's not what I meant. It's not what you said, but it's not even bad. That's fine  Uh, you say can we go right now and then did you reply with an attitude?  Did I did I make you mad? Did you reply with an attitude? Or do you say it? No, I was I was dead pan "
700,1:06:39,1:06:48,SPEAKER 1, I was annoyed but I didn't get mad at him. I was just like I was kind of stunned. I think I'm not kidding  I was stunned. I think I've realized what the problem is here. I cannot tell 
701,1:06:49,1:06:51,SPEAKER 4, Just just like the previous the previous argument 
702,1:06:51,1:07:02,SPEAKER 1, I can't tell if the story is being embellished for a podcast purposes. I'm swear to god. It's not no  I'm not because also I've never done that  It when I'm when I'm that angry on I'm retelling a story 
703,1:07:02,1:07:06,SPEAKER 3, You never ever publish a story for pocket purposes never 
704,1:07:06,1:07:32,SPEAKER 4," I swear to god because it because to me it's like I can't tell I actually  Just can't rehearn expressions. No, I can't tell if you want me to run. I  This is the conundrum I'm in right now  I because on one hand, I could agree with you and and pretend like I was the bad guy in the scenario and selfish  Or I could push back and actually defend what I think happened which is like  Like none of what you're describing is how I played out at all "
705,1:07:32,1:07:59,SPEAKER 1," Oh  As long as you do it succinctly and in entertaining way  It doesn't matter so so speak your truth. Yeah, this is what happened. I was stunned. I was like  Uh, I mean, I'd like that's how I was like and I was like wow. He's really asking me to do this and I was like  Why as you why?  Because I'm gonna like go down there and like I'm gonna be driving late and I don't you know  You kind of like that whiny mode and then I was like  That's finals drive myself "
706,1:07:59,1:08:16,SPEAKER 2," I I think this is reasonable  Because you need the favor sure and he has plans  So he's trying to make both work. He's not canceling on you because he has plans  He's just saying go an hour early  Which I don't think is if he said can we go five hours early? I'd be like that's yeah, it's annoying "
707,1:08:16,1:08:24,SPEAKER 1, It's not LAX though. It's like it's it's a pretty short airport ride  And so I'd have to spend another hour in the airport that I didn't have to which is I just read 
708,1:08:24,1:08:28,SPEAKER 3," If you said 30 minutes would you have been like yeah? Yeah, I think so why did you offer that then why didn't I "
709,1:08:29,1:08:42,SPEAKER 1," Because I'm not I don't want to ground. I don't want to negotiate  He obviously he obviously that just didn't want to do it. I think he just wanted to do it wants to do it  No, no, but it's like he was he's so much didn't want to do "
710,1:08:42,1:09:01,SPEAKER 3," I don't think Aiden would ask ever with the expectation of maybe I get out of this by asking this  And then he'll have to say yes or no. I think he was just like oh that would actually be very convenient  If we could leave slightly earlier because I don't want to get there so late. I'll get there like 10  And I'm also driving opposite direction  And so I think he was like well, what if we just because he didn't factor this in when he said yes originally "
711,1:09:01,1:09:09,SPEAKER 2," What if we leave earlier would you still be mad if when you asked him the first time he said it  I can go if we leave an hour early. Absolutely not. No. Okay, so it's that he changed "
712,1:09:09,1:09:16,SPEAKER 1," It's then I'd have to think about it and be like do I want to do that and I have time to think about it  But yes, the fact that you would have said no to that. I probably would "
713,1:09:16,1:09:24,SPEAKER 3, So I think Aiden is in the fault for being too good of a friend for saying yes before thinking. Oh  He cares so much. He didn't even think about 
714,1:09:27,1:09:43,SPEAKER 2," Feel this is reasonable, but I'm in the wrong. They feel like all he did was realize halfway through the day  Oh shit  I actually don't want the day to pan out this way time wise. I'll ask if we can go an hour earlier at the time  What if he has said I don't want to go an hour earlier, but can you still take me would you have said that I'm not going to take you anymore? "
715,1:09:46,1:09:48,SPEAKER 4, When he asked me to go now 
716,1:09:49,1:10:05,SPEAKER 2," But basically I said so when you say can we go an hour earlier if his response was I don't want to go an hour earlier  But can you still take me at the time that we originally said  Would you say no now with that? No, I would have said  Yeah, that's fine like we can still go then yeah, then all he's asking is just to go earlier "
717,1:10:05,1:10:27,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, but I think the idea of asking me to spend another hour in an airport where I have to sit with my own  Fingers in my butthole as opposed to doing the same thing in your  I feel I was busy. I was doing you can stay busy at the airport. Yeah, but I was doing shit at like home  I was like I was packing up so I was moving stuff like I was I was clearly active that day. I would argue  And so I was like "
718,1:10:29,1:10:39,SPEAKER 4, I'm assuming also I'm assuming it's not that because when this is all happening  It's like past 9 p.m. Already. I'm not assuming you're in the middle of like doing a bunch of shit  You know 
719,1:10:39,1:11:01,SPEAKER 3," Okay, I will also add in  I remember the conversation because you asked for it. I am immediately said no with zero context of when you're leaving  Because I was like oh, we just love to get ramen will probably make it and  Aiden immediately said yes with zero context of when you're leaving  I think yeah, and that just shows how we're different  But you weren't bad at Ludwig. He's that's what I'm saying  Aiden's a better friend than I am in the circumstances overall "
720,1:11:01,1:11:06,SPEAKER 1, I was mad at you guys because you you misread the time as well. I didn't misread it. You didn't say the time when I said no 
721,1:11:07,1:11:12,SPEAKER 3," Oh, that's right. Yeah, so you're dumb. I was at home when it is happened. Yeah, you were I messaged for us "
722,1:11:13,1:11:20,SPEAKER 2," No, I wasn't home when you were getting first message. I got home later. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I wasn't home when I read that  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's why I was like oh "
723,1:11:21,1:11:23,SPEAKER 3, I think 
724,1:11:23,1:11:32,SPEAKER 1, Slot Aiden's a better friend than I am if you guys if you guys face value think Aiden's a better friend  Maybe you are in the right you all I found it annoying. I don't think it's better friend 
725,1:11:32,1:11:35,SPEAKER 4, I think that wasn't it was fine the reason I was asking to leave early by the way 
726,1:11:35,1:11:40,SPEAKER 1, Pissy when he asked was not that's maybe that's why I was but I think you're projecting that dude 
727,1:11:40,1:12:20,SPEAKER 4," I think you'd be less mad at I did I was it I don't know what to say other than I wasn't  Also the reason I asked was because I wasn't like trying to go like fucking hang with the boys or like get some fucking  You know ming I was fucking I was I literally I was in like I was in like a personal fight with somebody  And it something had just happened like 15 minutes. That's why I was pissy. He was in trouble and  And it was like it would be it would be like shit  It's like it would be really good if I could go over and like figure this out and  And it's like hey, you know what?  It's like if I can leave earlier like if we can leave at like 930 instead of like leave at 10 "
728,1:12:21,1:12:33,SPEAKER 2, It's like that would be sick. I'm like you mind leaving early. I don't think he owes you all that context though  Then to ask the original question. I think he can just ask the question safely  And then get it on a stand so reason I even asked it that way 
729,1:12:33,1:12:43,SPEAKER 4," I said the reason I said do you mind if we leave earlier was because it leaves room for interpret  It's like oh, okay, maybe he can leave at 945 instead of 10 or maybe he can leave at 930 "
730,1:12:43,1:12:52,SPEAKER 1," It's like maybe he can't leave now. No, no, no, that's not it because I said when and you said like right now  And it was an hour before so it was an hour and I remember he offered that he offered that as time "
731,1:12:52,1:12:56,SPEAKER 2," Well, I guess the only way he's saying is he would have been okay with less time, but still more time "
732,1:12:57,1:12:59,SPEAKER 3, Nick are you team mr. Cleaner team vanilla ice 
733,1:13:00,1:14:04,SPEAKER 2," Team vanilla ice right now really? Yeah, I'm coming up to you and I was doing you a favor  I'm putting myself in his shoes if I was if I knew I was doing you a favor. I'm like damn  I don't want to go to LAX or I don't want to go to LAX. Sorry. I don't want to go to the airport  It's a way shorter shorter. I don't want to go to the airport right now  I'd rather be playing video games, but I'll do it because you're my friend  I know I'm doing you a favor and I'm like ooh actually I had all this editing I want to do tonight  And I don't want to start that at midnight instead of 11 so I'm gonna ask if we can leave an hour earlier  And I asked you and you got mad at me. I would be like that's an overreaction  No, if you explained why I would be that makes sense. Yeah, but if I didn't explain why I wouldn't expect you to be mad at me  But I would expect you first you would you would never not explain why but I know but I would I would hope that you would assume  As as me being your friend that I had a good reason instead of assuming I have a bad reason  If you were hard, it's a hard one. You assumed he had a bad reason or bad intention  Which is why I said I don't think you'd be as mad if I did it because for some reason  You wouldn't feel that way. I think you're right  But you're quicker to assume he has a bad reason because you think he's like a bad listener "
734,1:14:05,1:14:12,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, I think you're right. I think I think that's that's really I have a body Clarkson blowout. I have a bite everyone's going to create another phone "
735,1:14:12,1:14:18,SPEAKER 4," This like I think this like just quietly seeps into every every interaction. No, you are a nightmare "
736,1:14:19,1:14:21,SPEAKER 2, Don't let that get away. Yes 
737,1:14:22,1:14:27,SPEAKER 1, He's just wrong Paris social viewers are gonna freak out in this episode. They're all gonna fucking. Oh my god 
738,1:14:27,1:14:29,SPEAKER 2, They're gonna get this course about 
739,1:14:30,1:14:36,SPEAKER 1, They're gonna fault no someone's gonna get on the reddit and be like guys  I don't know what the vibe right now. It's like something's going wrong 
740,1:14:37,1:14:46,SPEAKER 4, I'm locked in it all white cell with the kids that were training to fight each other later in 20 years  That's where I am mentally 
741,1:14:47,1:15:05,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, well vote on your phone  It sounds like I lost this one  But I still in my heart believe if it was in front of a studio audience people be kind of like hmm  That's kind of fucked up and also I didn't blow up it. I didn't blow up it  And I was just like no just drive myself and I was annoyed but it that's why I brought it up because it was rich "
742,1:15:05,1:15:16,SPEAKER 2, Dream a didn't I think I think that you  Something that's innocent here. I think that you look at going to the airport early with much more to stay in than he would 
743,1:15:17,1:15:42,SPEAKER 1," Maybe yeah, yeah, cuz it's just the place that I also think that when people I I'm the kind of guy  I think when people ask me favors. I am just like that is priority now always always always  I never compromise and I never be like hey, can we push this back enough?  I do I feel like shit about it because I never get asked for shit  So I'm like maybe it's like easier. I don't ask for shit either  That's another thing. I feel like I'm very independent  So I'm like asking for a thing and then it gets changed up. I'm like how dare you "
744,1:15:42,1:15:46,SPEAKER 4, I hope that my I hope that my context of it being important 
745,1:15:48,1:15:51,SPEAKER 1, It doesn't make it less annoying. Do you want me to back you up? I got you get me get him 
746,1:15:51,1:15:53,SPEAKER 3, Lay up right now tabian

He's so dog pile in me. He's so quiet. You're dog  How could I see his hand? He's so quiet. You're dog in a corner and you help Saikuno and Bo Tez out 
749,1:16:14,1:16:17,SPEAKER 2," Well, hey, well to be fair when you sucked out the old Saikuno "
750,1:16:17,1:16:23,SPEAKER 1, I owed Saikuno and then you sucked out on me and you know what Alexander Bo Tez for calling our shill  I was a hero that he owes me 
751,1:16:23,1:16:26,SPEAKER 3, What are you for being like a terrorist in my life?

755,1:16:40,1:16:56,SPEAKER 3," Back in riot. Yeah, I just burned my Activision bridge. So I hope that's good. What'd you do?  I've just made a mobile mail about how through the worst video game company of all time. That's the title. Oh worst  It is pretty click baby  I don't believe that that they're the worst. I think they are of the major. Yeah, it could have been I think they're worse. Yeah "
756,1:16:58,1:17:02,SPEAKER 4," Oh, I was it you know, I was about to say Blizzard and then I was like they own them they do "
757,1:17:03,1:18:06,SPEAKER 3," I watched a movie last night.

I guess I called this to a T  Wait, the first thing they have to explain to her first things one of the first things the first thing was the iPhone, but like after that "
758,1:18:08,1:18:11,SPEAKER 2," Why is everyone wearing a mask? No, there's no COVID in this area. Yeah, that's I "
759,1:18:11,1:18:13,SPEAKER 3, but fair um 
760,1:18:14,1:18:18,SPEAKER 1, First thing they have to explain to her they have to explain to her 
761,1:18:19,1:18:21,SPEAKER 2, What we can't say a certain word 
762,1:18:22,1:18:42,SPEAKER 3," Her first slide is the only funny part of the movie she goes oh my god you being so retarded  Yeah, okay, yeah, and then they sit her down in the movie. They're like okay, so like actually you can't say that she's like oh, it's gay  I have a secret theory that they made it start in 2002 because they didn't want to explain 9-11 "
763,1:18:42,1:18:44,SPEAKER 1, Wait 
764,1:18:44,1:18:51,SPEAKER 3," Oh, she goes into the comment in 2002 she goes on 2000 and she pops out in 2022 they're like "
765,1:18:51,1:19:03,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, there's too much so terrorists. I think that's smart. Yeah, I think there was that that guy that got really mad at  That Pixar movie or that dream works movie whatever. Yeah, it's called it's the panda one "

767,1:19:06,1:19:12,SPEAKER 1," It's in Canada 2002. Yeah, and they're like there's just no mention of 9-11 and it's just like a cultural event  Some guys all mad about it "
768,1:19:12,1:19:17,SPEAKER 3, Everyone dunking on this person. It should be like a like a moment that like should at least be brought up 
769,1:19:17,1:19:39,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, dude youtube youtube  Criticism has gotten to a very weird and evil point. I think there's like I watch dark souls videos a lot  And there's a lot of trash and there's like your Vati videos and your like brothers code your good shit, right?  But then there's people are like this is my six hour review of dark souls and it's like brother  I love that game. There's nothing that you don't need to talk for six hours about this "
770,1:19:40,1:20:02,SPEAKER 2," There's that one youtuber uh fuck. I don't know their name. They do like  They do likes nine hour reviews of like Drake and Josh and like that's just funny  We have single episodes of like no like the series like they'll do like fuck what  They pretend you find this they'd they I've only heard positive things about this youtuber  I haven't watched a single video because what I fucking tall day. It's yeah, it's literally "
771,1:20:02,1:20:04,SPEAKER 1, I legally have to a lunch break. Yeah 
772,1:20:04,1:20:06,SPEAKER 3, I'm gonna watch the whole video you you should get paid to yeah 
773,1:20:06,1:20:15,SPEAKER 1, I think there's an inverse hour over time with like if if the more goofy the subject matter is and the longer  The thing is there's a relationship to how funny the whole 
774,1:20:16,1:20:21,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, for sure like if it was like 24 hours and it actually is all unique video. It's like damn. Yeah "
775,1:20:21,1:20:32,SPEAKER 1," That's pretty funny. I don't care what they say. There was this really old blog on Tumblr  It was a family guy reviewed and it was this unemployed guy who just smoke weed and he reviewed every single episode episode  Did I say family guy? Yes, it's full house "
776,1:20:33,1:20:37,SPEAKER 2, I just that was a brain which is the family guy live-action 
777,1:20:37,1:20:52,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, which is you would actually don't know it was full house reviewed which is way funnier because it's like a shitty sitcom  And he's just he's just dumping on full house talking about how much he hates it every single episode and it took him like  Three years to finish it was great. I liked full house. Well, you want to talk about your little endeavor "
778,1:20:52,1:20:57,SPEAKER 3," You've been on you're not leaking that yet. Oh, I stole it. So it's not that interesting. Oh, I don't sell it "
779,1:20:57,1:22:21,SPEAKER 2," Uh, would you steal this time? Anthony put me on to a pod about a list  About a list. They're pretty funny. They're funny  And one of them I don't it's one of those podcasts. I actually get now people who like comment on ours with like this huge like  Like gaps in their knowledge because like I listen to that podcast now every once in a while  But I don't know any of the people or what they look like or any of their names. I don't know who's talking  In my head. They're all Adam Friedland  Yeah, cuz they all kind of sound like Adam Friedland  And so my head I haven't seen any. Do I just imagine three Adam Friedland on the the couch like this  Like his four-night wash  And uh one of them has a letterbox account where he only writes like reviews that are not real  And it's just like he'll just take really good movies and call them fucking snooze fest  Like well like there's a lot of reviews that are like yeah  I slept through with the entire beginning to end of the movie. I hated it like that kind of stuff  And I made I made a letterbox account immediately after uh called bring back hip hop  uh  And all I do is write reviews and my guy is a guy who just saw death note and can't  Comparing it to every movie he watches  So it's like like he just watched like everything everywhere all at once  He gave it two stars and he's just like he's just comparing it to how like I see the death note vibes that everyone's talking about  But like didn't like what's all the bagel shit so weird was it was this before after what I tell you that was you "
780,1:22:21,1:22:24,SPEAKER 1, What I used linked me a random letterbox 
781,1:22:24,1:22:29,SPEAKER 2," No context. Yeah, I just like to have got what I see what he'd say and he was like yeah "
782,1:22:29,1:22:32,SPEAKER 1, I will I read I think what's on it. I was busy. I was at summit 
783,1:22:32,1:22:44,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, and then I have one Avengers endgame review five or four stars and just as wow  Four out of ten. Yeah, so this is a side product of mine right now. This is a no-one leak because you were watching "
784,1:22:44,1:23:04,SPEAKER 4," You started watching spy family with atriak and I watched the first couple episodes with you guys and I I  Just we started watching it and I was just  Watching it from the perspective of a guy who is convinced that this show is death note  And I was like oh, that's oh, that's L. That's how I like that guy. He's really good in the first half "
785,1:23:04,1:23:09,SPEAKER 3," I used to do this my HR was like slowly fucking losing his mind. Yeah, it's not funny. Okay "
786,1:23:09,1:23:21,SPEAKER 4, I thought it was funny the first time  But we're like 15 minutes into the first episode and I'm like  So that lights gonna find the book now lights gonna find the book  And I'm doing this for the entire episode 
787,1:23:24,1:23:27,SPEAKER 1, Is there is our point in the show where like an apple is shown on camera? 
788,1:23:27,1:23:31,SPEAKER 3," No, these are freaking out. That way that's operation fucking zero "
789,1:23:33,1:23:45,SPEAKER 1," A truck he when he gets met do a truck so funny because if he gets super annoyed with you, he's so  He's so bouncy. He'll be like  What are you doing that for like you always book and things with a little laugh. Yeah "
790,1:23:46,1:23:48,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, it's not fine. It does give you shit sandwich "
791,1:23:49,1:23:57,SPEAKER 1," So he's just imagining me at lexie like  Why are you doing that?  You're like that's L. Oh, I get it. Yeah, he's like you got a sound "
792,1:23:58,1:24:08,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, it's been definitely inspired me. I thought it was so good because me and A were just like being this guy to each other for a moment  We're spending like 20 minutes just being this guy. It's like we're watching like any movie and we're just like "
793,1:24:08,1:24:14,SPEAKER 1," Not like death note, but it's pretty good. It's just a visual medium  Version of the guy who just found out about the weekend. Yeah "
794,1:24:15,1:24:24,SPEAKER 2," It is very similar to that. It's like like yeah, I see what it's like kind of like a like a L like  Yeah, I'm gonna be like dynamic that they're establishing and I can feel that inspiration "
795,1:24:24,1:24:34,SPEAKER 4," But he's a friend he clearly doesn't have his best interests. He's kind of like re-euk  Like it's kind of like the death god. He's like always always around him, but he doesn't really care about him "
796,1:24:35,1:24:41,SPEAKER 1," I got love apples those love apples. I love that shit. Hey. Oh, we're all the red carpet for you king "
797,1:24:41,1:24:44,SPEAKER 3," I want to hear about little junior. Oh, you want to hear about "
798,1:24:44,1:24:51,SPEAKER 2," What love a junior did. Yeah, why did mango post that photo? Did you fucking love a junior money match zane and a best of five "
799,1:24:51,1:25:05,SPEAKER 3," The love with junior is Nick's jigglypuff. Yeah, this is the pictures all showing this is check mango's twitter and I check and it says that jmook has a  Harry asshole and then he's on that and then and this is the fucking picture. Yeah, so this is me standing over zane "
800,1:25:05,1:26:49,SPEAKER 2," What I'm literally saying to him is you baby-ass boy-ass  I said you wanted the greatest to if not the number one player in the world right now  I said you baby-ass boy-ass baby-ass. I kept saying that over and over and looping it  because  At the after party I cornered zane and I was like you want to play melee with me and he's like you want to play  I'm like yeah, and we the whole event we've been talking about puff and how much we both love playing puff  And he's like he's like he's like he's never seen big kid do that thing  Where you say oh wait, I shouldn't you he's like, yeah, I'm like do it. So say we're both it's like gawking or puff  And so we sit down and we both like neither of us are picking a character  We're just like kind of sitting there like feeling each other out. I mean, I'm like  So your Falco good. He's like my Falco is really good. And I'm like all right  I pick puff and he goes Falco and then he's like best of five. I'm like, yeah  And we play and my puff beats him my buff beats his Falco and that's not even that photo  I beat him and I'm making fun of him and I'm like  I'm like, what is that what would juniors take and fucking w's  Then we played a couple we played like what like one like one in the middle which was like  Uh, we like we like switch or something  And you're like I played whatever and we played I lost one and then I was like play my peach right now  And then goes back to Falco and I played peach and it was game five last stock and I won with peach  I guess it's Falco and then I get up over him  I'm on top of him like you baby. Yeah, it's fucking boy  And I wanted a cool way like I like a sick edge guard  And uh, it was and mango is just like mango looks like uh when your mom's taking a picture of you  He's holding the phone like this. So mangoes wasted. He's like this  He just takes he just takes like what looks like a photo and he goes down like this  And then he immediately after I win he goes check Twitter right now  He said if you ever come out with an album you got to use this photo  Was it for money? It's really good. Uh, it was it was full pride. It was pride match "
801,1:26:49,1:26:54,SPEAKER 3," Did you try to play your Falco against his puff? Yeah, yeah, I lost that one. That's what I figured it's nice "
802,1:26:54,1:27:28,SPEAKER 2," This bump is really good. This bump is better than mine for sure  It's like it's it but but the whole time he was playing my puff every single time I would do anything  He would say dude were the same puff  He would say we do are the exact same. I would do that there too. He just kept saying it mid match  That's cute. We both just do like cheesy like power shield rest at a shield. Yeah, you go for goofy shit  Yeah, yeah, I was watching Zane's puff play leffin and Zane's puff was like fucking leffin up  It's Fox and then leffin figured it out but but for a while he was fucking leffin up  And I was like dude your pup is insane. Oh, yeah, so uh, that's my biggest w "
803,1:27:28,1:27:37,SPEAKER 1," Massive it's also funny that you're not put like it's like yeah  That wasn't even the only one. Yeah, there's two there's two w's in there. So do you have a chance of winning falco ditto then? "
804,1:27:38,1:27:57,SPEAKER 2," I think I would have won the falco ditto for sure. Yeah, yeah, if I won a puff if the peach did it if the peach did it  The peach did it. Yeah, and then I think I should it's on my ice queen took it on who was it uh  Who was behind us watching um  It's like vish was just like uh. Oh, do you do you play peach now and Mike is watching you start laughing? He's like no "
805,1:27:57,1:28:05,SPEAKER 1, He's like he doesn't you should uh you should give him for uh force four of your  One-handed peach stocks to his one falco 
806,1:28:06,1:28:34,SPEAKER 2," I don't think I can do it. You can't do one-handed. Oh, uh his dude his falco was owning my peach  I just squeaked it out. I actually don't know how I want it  But the whole time during the peach puff match. He just he every time I take a stock  He like don't talk about on the podcast  It was just I don't want to be on the podcast. What's up Zane?  Yeah, what's a bitch? What's up baby as boy as Zane as after the event  I was like I'm talking. I'm yelling. I'm gonna talk it over. I mean he goes dude. I got fit  And I'm like I lay off like oh "
807,1:28:34,1:28:39,SPEAKER 3, All right. I'm sorry man. I don't know. He's just never be Ludwig or Ludwig Jr. Ever and I don't think ever will 
808,1:28:40,1:28:51,SPEAKER 1, Learn from learn from the greatest same. I learned from the greatest. I think I think it is  Because he's a fucking you dude. He's a fucking norm. Do you remember how you're to Zane now? One stock to four. Do you remember how 
809,1:28:51,1:29:49,SPEAKER 2," Don't beat me in it. Do you remember how mango said he would never watch me play melee? Do you know about that probably yeah  So mango told me he would never watch me play melee and I was like why and it's because he thinks I play  He like he is heard from others like so Brandon  Like things like the way up if I was cool and he heard that from Brandon  He was like I think you're so lame at every other video game that I don't want to see you do anything cool ever  So I'm not a gnome to ignore you play melee for the rest of my life and I was like yeah, okay, fair  But at summit I'm playing puffer's mic and he comes up behind me. He's like all right dick. Let's see what you got you think some Falco  And I go I'm like and then he sees like wait one week Jr. He's like are you puffed and I'm like yeah, he's like oh my god  Fuck you, and I'm like I don't want you to watch this one. Yeah, and then we're like 10 seconds into the game  And he goes oh shit. Oh fuck and Mike's like no no walk away  And then like I like I like miss a setup or something and then mango pops off at me missing something that almost could have been cool  And Mike's like he didn't even hit it and then goes like it's all about ideas "
810,1:29:51,1:30:01,SPEAKER 1," That's such a big voucher. It was just w's after w's mango watching your set behind though  Your friendly behind you was like the biggest pressure ever because it's like well, I got I got to be cool "
811,1:30:01,1:30:12,SPEAKER 2," Mike just watches me go from playing  Real melee to like only trying to be cool for me go like immediately with a light switch  What's up? What's what's up? Yeah, he's nervous "
812,1:30:12,1:30:17,SPEAKER 3, You let the question of our own that's right. We should have potato the cat. I don't love that 
813,1:30:20,1:30:27,SPEAKER 4, Question for you guys. Have you ever tried you know it within your memory? Have you ever tried breast milk? 
814,1:30:28,1:30:34,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, of course wait are you asking me as are you asking if I was breast bed? Both of these okay "
815,1:30:34,1:30:48,SPEAKER 1," There's two things that happened in my head right now one  Ain't just positing this question as if he's about to tell us that he just did and what do we say to but it sounds like that too  What do we saying absolutely?  Yeah, it's also crazy. Here's you look at those "
816,1:30:49,1:30:51,SPEAKER 2, That's what they call French milk yeah 
817,1:30:52,1:30:59,SPEAKER 3," At the store is just breast milk  Listen, it's not too precise "
818,1:30:59,1:31:03,SPEAKER 4, Some woman named Francine just says a massive and she just feels like my 
819,1:31:03,1:31:09,SPEAKER 1," My conversation friends. It's not percentages. This is though. The only way to get a hold of breast milk human, right? "
820,1:31:10,1:31:17,SPEAKER 2," Yes, okay is you have to be pregnant no or you have to buy it. I get a hold of breast milk with any y'all if I squeeze hard enough "
821,1:31:17,1:31:19,SPEAKER 4, Don't don't you remember me lactating? 
822,1:31:20,1:31:32,SPEAKER 3," Oh, you remember me lactating wait what what year? I  I think 2018 you was not  I want to say Ben or Miles is over and they pinched my nipple so hard that a little bit of juice came out "
823,1:31:34,1:31:45,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, probably just like like that's not yeah, I don't know. I mean, I would imagine you're  If you squeeze your homies tit and juice comes out, you should be obligated to try it. Yeah, yeah, I tried my own "
824,1:31:45,1:31:53,SPEAKER 1," That should be a lot. It's what yeah, you earned it. So does that count?  Why are you asking? Yeah, let's get to the mean you just you just said you tried it "
825,1:31:53,1:31:58,SPEAKER 3," I thought I was like, yes, I have had breast milk, but I don't necessarily remember it because I was a baby "
826,1:31:58,1:32:06,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, that's why I said within your memory  So you're like as in like do you do you presumably you do not remember drinking from your "
827,1:32:06,1:32:10,SPEAKER 3, I don't know if I was actually my first memory was pilo 
828,1:32:11,1:32:14,SPEAKER 1, We if I said that you'd be mad now. I know I'm in 
829,1:32:15,1:32:25,SPEAKER 3," If you said you drink my mom's breast milk  Different than if I'm saying I did it. No, he said do we went to New Hampshire. That's what I'm saying  That's right. He's all right breast milk "
830,1:32:26,1:32:27,SPEAKER 1, But if I said pilo was 
831,1:32:29,1:32:33,SPEAKER 3, When she's near closer to fucking her cuz you're so fucking old when she say goodbye 
832,1:32:33,1:32:36,SPEAKER 4," When she say goodbye, she all offered something. It's like it's rude "
833,1:32:37,1:32:44,SPEAKER 3, She asked if she could make me anything. I'm not gonna say no to your mom. I'm a hamster tradition  So it's a fresh thing in your hair 
834,1:32:45,1:32:48,SPEAKER 4, Cuz you want to milk with you to live live for your diet. That's right 
835,1:32:49,1:32:54,SPEAKER 1, She was all in it or like angry voice to like you like she's kind of annoyed like do you want some things for the road 
836,1:32:55,1:32:59,SPEAKER 3," She has to offer. Yeah, she still hates you by the way. No, she doesn't "
837,1:33:00,1:33:01,SPEAKER 2, Go ahead 
838,1:33:01,1:33:08,SPEAKER 1, Not why you asking I tried it. I did try what this week  Who's 
839,1:33:08,1:33:17,SPEAKER 4, Was it I can't sell out my source it from the  But I tried I tried it. Did you drink it from the bottle or from the tap from a bottle 
840,1:33:17,1:33:19,SPEAKER 3, That's better 
841,1:33:21,1:33:31,SPEAKER 4," Die your hair blonde as I suck in breast milk. That's what made it turn blot. I tried formula, dude  I tried bolt. Well, you just hung out with someone the baby and got nuts. Well, they offered "
842,1:33:32,1:33:34,SPEAKER 3," Dude, what the fuck are you doing? "
843,1:33:34,1:34:01,SPEAKER 4," Hold on. I didn't do it in front of the baby like  You're lunch today. Let's fill it back. Yeah, how was it? Yeah, okay, so normal breast milk  Is as opposed to as opposed to formula  It's like it's like weirdly sweet  Like house like give me a rain like I feel like almost like condensed milk like it's actually like surprisingly "
844,1:34:02,1:34:05,SPEAKER 1," You can make Vietnamese coffee with breast milk. Yeah, they do actually "
845,1:34:06,1:34:12,SPEAKER 4, It's called a lot of small coffee Thai tea with breast milk. You don't tell the difference what Thai tea is 
846,1:34:13,1:34:15,SPEAKER 1, Should I just stop we're in that 
847,1:34:16,1:34:21,SPEAKER 4, formula formula honestly it tastes like fucking metal like it tastes terrible 
848,1:34:22,1:34:27,SPEAKER 3," Okay, that's good given the mire taste it shit is it so formula is what they make it a lab "
849,1:34:27,1:34:31,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, yeah formula is the science and how they make formula formula "
850,1:34:32,1:34:40,SPEAKER 3, You like bully them do they make like synthetic tits and they milk them  How do you get formula powder? I don't they make it in a in a lab like a really hard math equation 
851,1:34:41,1:34:43,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, and then you just the juice just comes out of your "
852,1:34:43,1:34:46,SPEAKER 4, It's a fucking station next to the dogs and 
853,1:34:48,1:35:17,SPEAKER 1," Somewhere in the same building there's a movie called the fuck every what it's called  But it's like this future where vampires have taken over the world like how like the natural progression like death note  It's like death note and there's apples and lots of a bunch of re-eux and it's like there's this like  There's so many vampires, but there's not enough people and so they eat fake blood  But the real blood tastes real good. It's a shit movie, but it's a cool concept anyway  It's like there's like this. It's not there's just there's this factory and it's just got humans like being milked and farmed "
854,1:35:17,1:35:21,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, right? So it's like the matrix and blade kind of yeah kind of yeah "
855,1:35:21,1:35:36,SPEAKER 1," And I'm just imagining that, but it's like it's just like  He wore in the janitor's big beautiful tits just being milked and milked and milked over and over and over and over  And that's what you buy at the store. Dude, there's a formula shortage. You dreamt that. Yeah, there's a formula shortage and I got a piece "
856,1:35:36,1:35:38,SPEAKER 3, The hell 
857,1:35:39,1:35:44,SPEAKER 4, This is like hungry one baby died because of my actions this week. I'm proud of you. But I had to do it 
858,1:35:44,1:35:54,SPEAKER 1," For science for science and it tasted bad because no adults have ever tried before and I wanted to be the first also  Would you really be mad brand? No, it's like the name of the thing. It's just the name of baby's baby milk "
859,1:35:55,1:35:59,SPEAKER 3," Or maybe it's like what if it was a brand that turned into like a comic like play next. Yeah, like clean "
860,1:35:59,1:36:03,SPEAKER 2," That's trying to calm baby form. Yeah, I'm gonna look this up, bro. I'll be good, bro "
861,1:36:03,1:36:16,SPEAKER 1," So wait is that it we hit an idea? I feel like you should just you drink breast milk  Just tell us why you did like what the context is it too secret? No, I wanted to know  But you were just around and it was there ask her to they offer they offered "
862,1:36:17,1:36:32,SPEAKER 4," They do you think that's normal and no, no, I was like this is another woman's breast milk that you're like signing off on me tasting  It's not like that's okay, right? What?  What weird scenario what the fuck is going on back alley deal? "
863,1:36:32,1:36:36,SPEAKER 3," Wait, what do you say he did not drink it with the mother's consent? "
864,1:36:37,1:36:41,SPEAKER 1, What the fuck? I literally think it's a crime in some Starbucks 
865,1:36:41,1:36:49,SPEAKER 4, You don't just get to have milk  If you get the riddle the day right you get it. It's like oh milk. It's like it's like super casually 
866,1:36:50,1:36:53,SPEAKER 3, Like not a big deal. So weird like fair facts. They offer that 
867,1:36:54,1:36:58,SPEAKER 1," Well, hey yarn begins if you've had some breast milk. Would you go back "
868,1:36:59,1:37:02,SPEAKER 4, What more would I try it again go back for seconds? No 
869,1:37:02,1:37:09,SPEAKER 3, Because now it feels like I'm taking but like it assuming that breast milk would ran rampant like waterfalls 
870,1:37:09,1:37:14,SPEAKER 4," Would you then would I would I would I order it like if like get it in my coffee? Yeah, were you like? "
871,1:37:14,1:37:18,SPEAKER 3," I don't kind of try this again. No, it's a little too sweet really. It's a little weird, but it doesn't taste bad "
872,1:37:18,1:37:25,SPEAKER 1," It isn't as bad to like my I like breast milk, but sweetened with monk fruit  You know, so there's not a lot of calories sure "
873,1:37:25,1:37:31,SPEAKER 4, That's why it did peak my curiosity because I was like this probably changes depending on what the person eats 
874,1:37:32,1:37:34,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, they eat a bunch of so they pie that will taste good "
875,1:37:34,1:37:39,SPEAKER 4," Well, I'm trying to say this tastes like the woman gun milk patch lactating women watching the hot test "
876,1:37:39,1:37:50,SPEAKER 2, So I can't figure I can't find the answer for why it's called formula  But I did find where formulas started and it was just this dude who made it and he called it just this Von Lee big soup for infants 
877,1:37:53,1:37:56,SPEAKER 1, Why did we change that sounds like one of eight in steam names 
878,1:37:58,1:38:00,SPEAKER 2," Dude, we should keep calling it that's pretty hard "
879,1:38:01,1:38:05,SPEAKER 3, You're gonna say there's any women out there who have the breast milk 
880,1:38:05,1:38:09,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, if there's any women who watch the podcast, you happen to be lactated. You have to be a little bored "
881,1:38:10,1:38:15,SPEAKER 3," Send me on over yeah, what what tell them what the what's the call to action? You're bored of lactating and in Wilshire, bored "
