0,0:00:00,0:00:07,SPEAKER 1, Hello and welcome to Dear John and Hank. 
1,0:00:07,0:00:12,SPEAKER 2," Or as I like to think of it, the actual name of the podcast, Dear Hank and John. "
2,0:00:12,0:00:33,SPEAKER 1," Sorry, Hank, I've been gone for a few weeks and I wanted to just take control of the  reins today.  It's a comedy podcast about death where two brothers offer you dubious advice, answer your  questions, and bring you all the week's news from both Mars and da da da da da da da da da da!  A. F. C. Wimbledon!  Lead one's richest side!  More to come, we're in the podcast. "
3,0:00:33,0:00:38,SPEAKER 2," There's news, John.  How are you doing today? "
4,0:00:38,0:00:51,SPEAKER 1," Well, we're in real life together, Hank.  We're in Los Angeles, California.  I'm in a great mood because the movie rights to my book, Turtles All the Way Down,  it's happening. "
5,0:00:51,0:00:52,SPEAKER 2, Someone purchased them. 
6,0:00:52,0:01:01,SPEAKER 1," Not just someone, the same people from Fox 2000 who made the fault in our stores and  picked returns movies, Elizabeth Gabor and Aaron Seminoff. "
7,0:01:01,0:01:12,SPEAKER 2, How do you find out about that?  What happens when you find out that someone got the movie rights to your book as a person  who has no thing that this will one day maybe happen to him? 
8,0:01:12,0:02:18,SPEAKER 1," No thing.  Have you been drinking?  A little bit.  Okay.  So, first you get a phone call that says that somebody's interested in the movie rights  and then in this case, like eight weeks later, after lots of conversations and talking  about how to visualize deeply internal abstract thought processes, you decide to do it.  I'm really excited, I'm so, I, it's just, I did not think that this would ever be a  movie.  I didn't think that anybody could see it as a movie, but I don't know, I was just so  moved by the way they talked about it and the way the way that they're thinking about  it and I can't, I can't wait.  I am really thrilled.  Now, not everything that gets optioned becomes a movie.  It's not guaranteed to become a movie, but it is really exciting and these, it's the  same people who made the fault in our stores and paper towns movies.  I trust them so much, the relationship that we've, we've had over the years has been so  cool.  So it's really exciting.  How are you doing?  I'm good.  It's late.  It's 9.27. "
9,0:02:18,0:02:41,SPEAKER 2," It's, it's late for me.  I'm sleepy.  I got up at 4.40 this morning.  So there, that's, that's how I'm feeling, but I'm glad that we could be in the same place  to make a podcast together and I'm glad that we could learn together a little bit about  what people are curious about in the world and also maybe about cups. "
10,0:02:41,0:02:49,SPEAKER 1," Well, you haven't been drinking.  Hank.  Yeah.  Would you like a question from our listeners? "
11,0:02:49,0:02:51,SPEAKER 2, You don't want to read my poem. 
12,0:02:51,0:02:52,SPEAKER 1, What's your poem? 
13,0:02:52,0:02:55,SPEAKER 2, My poem and I posted about the fruit flies. 
14,0:02:55,0:03:05,SPEAKER 1," You can just go ahead and read it.  People can, people can hear all your typing and it makes them think that you're not paying  attention to the pod.  I'm looking up my fruit fly poem. "
15,0:03:05,0:03:19,SPEAKER 2," A fruit fly flew through my window screen there between the window and the screen she  pupated.  Now, too large to fit back through the screen.  She wanders in the sunlight, searching alone. "
16,0:03:19,0:03:26,SPEAKER 1," That's good, Hank.  I would not pursue a career as a poet, as such, but I think that was very good. "
17,0:03:26,0:03:46,SPEAKER 2," There's also a huge problem, which is the adult fruit flies camp pupate, which is just  it's not, that's not how it works.  Well, I'm only larva pupate and then they become adults and that's the whole thing and  I feel weird that that scientifically inaccurate and also bad poem got 2,000 likes on Twitter. "
18,0:03:46,0:03:51,SPEAKER 1," 2,000 likes and people really will hit that heart button for anything these days. "
19,0:03:51,0:03:55,SPEAKER 2," Well, I'll tell you what, that is actually one of my more successful tweets recently. "
20,0:03:55,0:04:11,SPEAKER 1," You know, I've noticed that there's this whole thing on Twitter where people are taking  that great William Carlos Williams poem about the plums and turning it into lyrics from  the popular music song All Star, are you familiar with this meme?  No.  Do you know the poem in question? "
21,0:04:11,0:04:13,SPEAKER 2," No, but I do know All Star. "
22,0:04:13,0:04:46,SPEAKER 1," Okay, great.  So there's a William Carlos Williams poem.  I don't know exactly how it goes, but I'm going to give you my version of it.  This is my attempt to recite a William Carlos Williams poem.  I've had a couple drinks, but fewer than Hank.  I have taken the plums that were in the ice box and which you were probably saving for  breakfast, forgive me, they were delicious, so sweet and so cold.  And here's the version that's been making the rounds on the social media, Hank.  Okay. "
23,0:04:46,0:04:51,SPEAKER 2," Hey now, you're in ice box, get your plums on, so sweet. "
24,0:04:51,0:04:56,SPEAKER 1," That's not the best version.  Hank, that's not the best version at all. "
25,0:04:56,0:05:03,SPEAKER 2," I was on a website that was telling me these plum jokes, and now there's a video playing "
26,0:05:03,0:05:07,SPEAKER 1," this construction unfolds into a home in just hours and costs only $33,000. "
27,0:05:07,0:05:11,SPEAKER 2," And I'm like, this is not what was happening. "
28,0:05:11,0:05:22,SPEAKER 1," I was not on a whole construction website.  I was looking at plumbing.  Whoa, whoa, suddenly Hank went from like pleasant drunk to really aggressive belligerent drunk. "
29,0:05:22,0:05:24,SPEAKER 2," I just don't like it when video is auto-played, John. "
30,0:05:24,0:05:33,SPEAKER 1," You are coming way too hard about video is auto-playing.  By the way, you know where I like video is auto-playing at youtube.com slash vlog brothers. "
31,0:05:33,0:05:36,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, because it's because it's what I'm there for. "
32,0:05:36,0:05:41,SPEAKER 1, How do you how do you like a moment on Twitter? 
33,0:05:41,0:05:57,SPEAKER 2, Now I'm falling asleep and she's eating my plums and he's open the ice box and she's  taking a plum.  Now I'm looking for plums and my stomach feels sick.  Now it's all in my head.  It's so sweet and so cold now.  I don't really know how that song goes that way. 
34,0:05:57,0:06:05,SPEAKER 1, I'm gonna say that Nick for Hank's sake.  To eat that.  A little bit of cold plums in my life.  There you go. 
35,0:06:05,0:06:16,SPEAKER 2," A little bit of ice box by my side, a little bit of breakfast, what you need, a little  bit of forgiveness is what I seek, a little bit of delicious, those plums, little "
36,0:06:16,0:06:20,SPEAKER 1," little sleep plums all night long.  All right, here we go, here we go, here we go. "
37,0:06:20,0:06:21,SPEAKER 2, What do you got? 
38,0:06:21,0:06:44,SPEAKER 1," A thousand likes.  Well the plums start coming and they won't stop coming, got to hit the ice box for some  more cold plum and didn't make sense to eat, didn't make sense to eat lukewarm plums.  You got the ice box, so go chill them son.  I don't think this person's ever actually heard all star but that was close, that was close.  That was like, there's like an algorithm wrote a version of all star.  I have heard.  I have heard. "
39,0:06:44,0:06:57,SPEAKER 2," I saw like happening on Twitter, they were cold plums and people were talking about it.  As far as I got into the meme until now and I feel like I'm explaining something that  everybody already knows about. "
40,0:06:57,0:07:04,SPEAKER 1," But the great thing is that because we're recording this in the relatively distant past,  everyone will have forgotten about this meme by the time the video. "
41,0:07:04,0:07:12,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, they'll be like, oh I remember the good old days, I mean back when all those terrible  things that have happened said that hadn't happened and we joked about plums. "
42,0:07:12,0:07:56,SPEAKER 1," At least it wasn't nuclear winter.  This first question comes from Nick who writes, dear John and Hank, I've been sick lately.  My doctor told me to try gargling with saltwater to help my sore throat while I was stirring  up a mug of the stuff using an artisimate mug.  I got from dftba.com, my number one source for brand to drink where man, this guy knows  how to get his question to ask the ones you're into, John.  I started to notice that as more and more of the salt began to dissolve, the sound of my  spoon tapping against the inside of the mug became gradually higher and higher in pitch  until all the salt was dissolved and the pitch became consistent.  I was able to replicate this with another mug of saltwater later on, I haven't measured  the difference.  I don't know from what I could tell the pitch raised by nearly an octave.  Whoa, still sick, come on Nick.  Nice. "
43,0:07:56,0:08:06,SPEAKER 2," I am impressed that you can tell the pitch change, you were like, oh, that I did it in "
44,0:08:06,0:08:17,SPEAKER 1," the question asking.  No, the question asking.  I'm great.  Yeah, go.  It's because I'm a great singer.  Oh, right.  A little bit of plum life in my life.  A little bit of plum life.  A John's life.  What is it?  What's the answer? "
45,0:08:17,0:08:24,SPEAKER 2," Well, I have noticed this a number of times when I'm stirring a gatorade into a cup. "
46,0:08:24,0:08:45,SPEAKER 1," Sure.  Because you've got to stir that gatorade.  You're going to have to buy a bottle of gatorade.  I buy liquid gatorade.  You do?  Yeah, but I know that you come from a humbler background and it's a harder for you.  By a humbler background.  Yeah.  And the same home as you.  Oh, just more recently. "
47,0:08:45,0:09:11,SPEAKER 2," I don't just buy powdered gatorade for frugality.  I also get to make it the exact level of sweetness that I want, which is not the sweetness.  I mean, obviously, it's never going to be the exact preference of a person.  If it's standardized for everybody.  So I like to be able to make my gatorade to the sweetness that I want.  And there's only one way to do that two ways.  You could buy liquid gatorade and then water it down also. "
48,0:09:11,0:09:39,SPEAKER 1," You could do that.  But I like to do it my way.  I like what I actually like a little bit sweeter than it comes.  So what I do is I just open the bottle up and I wait for eight or nine days just for  some evaporation.  Everybody has a different way, but that's my way.  That's good.  At all times, I like aging your gatorade.  I always have 10 open bottles of gatorade at different levels of sweetness.  Why does this happen?  Was the question not, how do you like your gatorade? "
49,0:09:39,0:09:42,SPEAKER 2," Well, the problem, John, is that I don't really know. "
50,0:09:42,0:09:46,SPEAKER 1, Great.  Let's move on to the next question. 
51,0:09:46,0:09:52,SPEAKER 2, But I wanted to talk about gatorade.  But it's weird to me because the pitch lowers when I'm using gatorade and apparently 
52,0:09:52,0:09:54,SPEAKER 1, goes up when you use salt. 
53,0:09:54,0:10:04,SPEAKER 2," So probably I have something to do with viscosity, but that's all I got for you.  Somebody knows the answer to this question.  In fact, I've read an article about this and I forgot it.  I forgot it because that's what you do with information. "
54,0:10:04,0:10:14,SPEAKER 1," This next question comes from Andrew who writes Dear John and Hank, I only discovered the  podcast last week and I've been listening to eight episodes a day while at work.  Andrew, you work too much. "
55,0:10:14,0:10:17,SPEAKER 2," Also, you listen to podcasts too much while you're working. "
56,0:10:17,0:11:00,SPEAKER 1," Getting divorced after 25 years of marriage, well, this took a turn.  While I know they'll be both happier after it, the whole thing is making me cynical about  love.  Does all love fade over time?  What's the point in trying if over half of marriages fail?  How do I stop this from happening in my future romances?  I appreciate your dubious advice, definitely not a hurricane.  Andrew.  First off, Andrew, not over half of marriages fail.  All marriages end either in death or divorce, annulment, good point, Hank, really good point.  So all marriages fail, I mean, because nothing lasts forever, not even cold November rain,  as Guns n' Roses once memorably put it.  Good. "
57,0:11:00,0:11:01,SPEAKER 2, All very good. 
58,0:11:01,0:11:16,SPEAKER 1," Every rose has its thorn, just like every cowboy has a sad, sad song.  Just like every...  That doesn't rhyme.  Every...  Every Tuesday.  Every...  Yeah.  Every poem.  Every cold poem.  Every... "
59,0:11:16,0:11:20,SPEAKER 2, Every boyfriend eats that plum in the box. 
60,0:11:20,0:11:25,SPEAKER 1," Wait, start over from scratch, so it seems like you're just coming up with it now. "
61,0:11:25,0:11:27,SPEAKER 2, Every plum's cold in a box. 
62,0:11:27,0:11:29,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.  That's good. 
63,0:11:29,0:11:33,SPEAKER 2, And every boyfriend steals your plums from that box. 
64,0:11:33,0:12:05,SPEAKER 1," That's good.  What?  You gotta hit the last note.  Maybe like every plum in that box.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know the song goes.  I don't know either.  I don't know either.  By the way, I don't think that song is November rain, I think it is a different song from  the same era.  Yeah, you're right.  Yeah.  That's definitely the case.  Yeah.  That's every rose has its thorn.  Every rose has its thorn.  By the way, Andrew.  I mean, the answer to your question is that every rose has its thorn, man.  I mean, that's...  Here's the thing. "
65,0:12:05,0:12:09,SPEAKER 2," That's true.  Every in cold November rain, even that ends. "
66,0:12:09,0:12:15,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.  And it's also true that every rose has its thorn.  Love is a rose. 
67,0:12:15,0:12:17,SPEAKER 2, So you better not pick it.  It only grows when it's on the vine. 
68,0:12:17,0:12:18,SPEAKER 1, It's very true. 
69,0:12:18,0:12:24,SPEAKER 2," A handful of thorns, and you know you missed it.  You lose your love when you steal the frickin' ice box from the plums. "
70,0:12:24,0:12:34,SPEAKER 1, I don't think you steal the ice box from the plums.  As such.  Is that the second time we've made an as such joke in this?  I don't know. 
71,0:12:34,0:12:39,SPEAKER 2," If it is Nick, cut off the as such and he didn't need to go there. "
72,0:12:39,0:13:09,SPEAKER 1," Here's the thing.  Andrew, I'm sorry that your parents are getting divorced, but it should not make you  cynical about love.  Because love brought you into this world.  Love is both how you became a person and also why you became a person to quote my own  book, Turtles All the Way Down, Parable, and Bookstores everywhere.  And don't be...  It's okay to go through a morning process and a grieving process and I think that's  natural and good, but that does not mean that life is hopeless.  It just means that life does involve loss. "
73,0:13:09,0:13:16,SPEAKER 2," Yes.  And that things that are wonderful don't baste forever, like roses, maybe.  I don't know. "
74,0:13:16,0:13:21,SPEAKER 1," Also, like plums in the ice box, I mean no matter how cold that ice box is, they're  not going to last forever. "
75,0:13:21,0:13:26,SPEAKER 2, Eventually they're not going to be a little...  What are plums on their dried?  They're going to be prunes. 
76,0:13:26,0:15:10,SPEAKER 1," That's why I had to eat the plums.  I just...  You were saving them for breakfast, but breakfast's win.  Tomorrow?  Why eat them tomorrow when you can eat them today?  Alright, Hank, this next question...  Oh my god!  Today's...  It's John's question day.  I've missed three weeks.  I've been...  It's good.  Sure it goes.  This next question comes from a guy who writes Dear John and Hank last year,  I participated in a stage production theater workshop thing.  On the day we were supposed to present our final product of play, our lovely stage director  decided to do a few exercises to calm our nerves before the show.  It only ended up making me more anxious, like everything that's ever been designed to  calm anyone's nerves.  Anyway, that wasn't the question.  She instructed us to scream out loud as loud as we could, one after the other, only one  problem.  I don't know how to scream.  So while waiting on my turn, I was trying to understand the mechanism that is screaming,  while simultaneously asking the people next to me how they acquired the art of screaming  which only made me more confused because the kind of advice I received went along the lines  of, I don't know, just let it flow.  But what does that mean?  How do I let it flow?  What do I need to let flow?  So many questions.  I didn't end up finding out how to scream, and I proceeded to let out a weird guttural  noise that resembled a loud snore.  I have spoken to almost any advice on how to scream.  All right, here's what I want you to do, Anias.  I want you to close your eyes, I want you to imagine that there's an ice box.  You've been saving these plums.  You've been saving the plums for so long.  They've reached the perfect moment between plum and prune, the moment at which you love  to have them for breakfast. "
77,0:15:10,0:15:13,SPEAKER 2," They say that every plum has its thorn, but not these plums. "
78,0:15:13,0:15:38,SPEAKER 1," In fact, no plums.  I don't think.  They say that.  Do that?  Every plum has its thorn.  Never heard that one.  Anyway Anias, I want you to picture that situation and then you open that ice box and what  is in there?  Nothing.  How do you feel right now?  That wasn't a scream.  Where in a hotel room?  It's true if we scream.  In 942.  Yeah.  I don't want to get security. "
79,0:15:38,0:15:47,SPEAKER 2, This is really interesting to me because I think that it's awful.  That's definitely not a scream. 
80,0:15:47,0:15:52,SPEAKER 1, The other day.  I'm going to go down one octave. 
81,0:15:52,0:15:55,SPEAKER 2, The other day I had a baby carrier on. 
82,0:15:55,0:15:56,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
83,0:15:56,0:16:36,SPEAKER 2," And it has this mechanism you have to push multiple buttons at the same time to unlock  it so that your baby doesn't accidentally fall out or something.  And I only hit one of the right buttons and I pulled and then the gap was created and  then my finger went in the gap and then I couldn't get it out.  My hand slipped and it slid onto my finger.  And it pinched me so hard that it broke the skin and I made this noise.  In the back of the car with the baby and Catherine thinks the baby is making that noise  because it's a tarot, like a very not human man noise and she's like freaking out like "
84,0:16:36,0:16:37,SPEAKER 1, what's wrong? 
85,0:16:37,0:16:41,SPEAKER 2," Well, that's a very weird one in the baby make and it just, but then I pulled my hand out "
86,0:16:41,0:16:52,SPEAKER 1," and I mean it, oh wow.  I think we could loop that noise that you just made and turn it into a really bad print  song.  Like it would be the worst print song. "
87,0:16:52,0:16:53,SPEAKER 2, There are no bad print songs. 
88,0:16:53,0:17:09,SPEAKER 1," That's a good point Hank.  Well, I could loop the sound that you just made and turn it into like a cover, a really  bad cover of a really good print song.  This next question comes from Warren.  Did we answer that one?  Oh yeah.  How do you scream? "
89,0:17:09,0:17:43,SPEAKER 2," I just think this is interesting.  I think that it's like knowing that you don't know how to make all of the noises because  it's like, it took me a while to realize that that there were noises I hadn't learned  and I just had to learn that like of course when I was like a child and learning to speak,  but you can speak in different ways and getting gaining full use of your voice or at least  more use than you are than you once had is like a process and it's not something that  everybody just does.  And I know a lot of people who have a hard time making loud noises. "
90,0:17:43,0:17:45,SPEAKER 1, I still can't.  I think it's legit. 
91,0:17:45,0:17:52,SPEAKER 2, I mean like you have to go someplace where you know when it's listening and be like I'm  going to try to make noises like other people do. 
92,0:17:52,0:18:04,SPEAKER 1," Or just don't learn how to scream and just wait for the moment when you really need  it.  And then I bet you'll find it.  Like when it's an emergency and it's not like the stage manager being like, I don't  have to get rid of your anxiety. "
93,0:18:04,0:18:09,SPEAKER 2, Let's have everybody scream by themselves like everybody is screaming together at least then 
94,0:18:09,0:18:10,SPEAKER 1, I can fake it. 
95,0:18:10,0:18:15,SPEAKER 2, But it's like you scream right and no I don't want to get in front of a bunch of people. 
96,0:18:15,0:18:47,SPEAKER 1," Too much pressure.  Yeah, that's terrifying.  Terrifying.  But you know what an exercise.  You know what sound I can't make?  What?  Most all of the sounds associated with proper Spanish pronunciation, at least according to  my children because my kids learn mostly in Spanish.  They speak mostly Spanish at school.  And when I try to speak to them in Spanish or say anything in Spanish, they always say,  okay.  I was like, they understand like I'm Spanish, but they literally don't know what I'm  saying. "
97,0:18:47,0:18:48,SPEAKER 2," They're like, that is like daddy. "
98,0:18:48,0:18:49,SPEAKER 1," No, that's wrong. "
99,0:18:49,0:18:50,SPEAKER 2, Like Alice in her ice water. 
100,0:18:50,0:19:29,SPEAKER 1," Yeah.  You're like, no, no, daddy in Spanish.  She should always say, in Espanol you say, no, and then I'll be like, no, I just, no,  daddy.  In Espanol we say, no, that's very cute.  All right.  Just next question comes from Warren who writes, dear John and Hank, I just have no power  over the podcast.  Well, you know what Hank, I was going for a long time.  Now, once our holiday spectacular is over, you can go back to answering half the questions  and also doing the intro.  I just started until Elon Musk doesn't get to Mars in 20, 27.  I just started seeing this person and he is literally perfect for me. "
101,0:19:29,0:19:34,SPEAKER 2," Literally, perfect is, that's a lot of different qualifies. "
102,0:19:34,0:19:39,SPEAKER 1," Warren, let's, if you just started seeing each other, let's not, okay, he's smart, he's "
103,0:19:39,0:19:40,SPEAKER 2," funny, he's cute. "
104,0:19:40,0:19:49,SPEAKER 1, We like him.  He's great.  I like him too.  Let's not put too much pressure on the situation.  Yeah.  There's a huge catch.  He's moving in four months to join the Navy Seals. 
105,0:19:49,0:19:54,SPEAKER 2, That doesn't sound perfect.  That sounds like he's moving in four months to join the Navy Seals. 
106,0:19:54,0:20:32,SPEAKER 1," I'm moving in seven months to start law school.  Well, those three months, when he's in the Navy Seals and you're not in law school, you  guys will have a great time together.  He's going to be tired all the time, no.  Before we met, we had both intentionally stayed single to focus on our career.  However, we both know that we have something special, uh, trademark.  Please forgive this because I know how ridiculous and cheesy I sound.  We want to give things time to breathe and grow, but I could already feel this ominous ticking  clock.  My focus is completely on law school, but I've always believed that we should love whenever  and wherever and however we can.  Any advice I've ever dubious would be greatly appreciated, not trying to live in a Hallmark  Christmas movie.  Lauren.  Lauren.  Just date.  Long distance.  Yeah. "
107,0:20:32,0:20:35,SPEAKER 2," I mean, you're allowed to live in a Hallmark Christmas movie. "
108,0:20:35,0:20:53,SPEAKER 1," Yeah.  Sounds very Hallmark Christmasy.  I mean, you're going to finish law school at right about the same time that he's going  to be entering his third year in the Navy Seals and then you get married.  We're not.  Whatever.  Stop putting so much pressure on the situation, Lauren.  It's okay.  I mean, it is hard. "
109,0:20:53,0:21:03,SPEAKER 2," It's hard when you've got a thing, you know, like this is going to be good, but then there's  this thing that isn't either of you.  It's just the universe conspiring against this leftliness. "
110,0:21:03,0:21:10,SPEAKER 1," Right.  Like circumstances are organizing themselves, not in your favor.  Right. "
111,0:21:10,0:21:16,SPEAKER 2, And that is important to realize that John I've ever told you about the time with the milk  when I was in middle school. 
112,0:21:16,0:21:17,SPEAKER 1, No. 
113,0:21:17,0:21:20,SPEAKER 2," So I was, this is a very applicable story. "
114,0:21:20,0:21:21,SPEAKER 1, Okay. 
115,0:21:21,0:21:31,SPEAKER 2," I was, I was a middle school student and some young people stole my milk, my chocolate  milk, my unopened 25 cent chocolate milk. "
116,0:21:31,0:21:32,SPEAKER 1, I remember. 
117,0:21:32,0:22:15,SPEAKER 2," And they were passing it around on the table, keep away from, from a nerdy Hank boy.  And they then swapped it for a chocolate milk that had been drunk, but they had closed  to the little carton so that it looked like it hadn't, and they gave it to me.  And I was like, I think, and then I got mad, extra mad because I thought that they were  giving it and being nice, but it turned out that the meanness was continuing.  And then I threw it back at them.  And then they threw it out into the middle of the cafeteria where I proceeded to go over  and stomp on it and realize that it was the original not-empty milk. "
118,0:22:15,0:22:16,SPEAKER 1, How is this story applicable? 
119,0:22:16,0:22:28,SPEAKER 2," It's applicable because they didn't intend for me to stomp on the milk.  That was like, that was farther than they wanted to take it. "
120,0:22:28,0:22:41,SPEAKER 1," Who, who, who are the like mean milk stealing jocks of this store, of the story of the Navy  Seal and the law school students? "
121,0:22:41,0:22:43,SPEAKER 2," The, the Navy Seals in law school. "
122,0:22:44,0:22:47,SPEAKER 1," Oh, you mean like the institutions are the bad guys? "
123,0:22:47,0:22:58,SPEAKER 2," We're just the situation, okay.  And it's just like, it was, it was set up like, it's not, it's not perfectly, it's not  a perfect analogy. "
124,0:22:58,0:23:04,SPEAKER 1, I would actually go further than that.  I would say that it's also not a good analogy. 
125,0:23:04,0:23:09,SPEAKER 2, And it may have nothing to do with the situation. 
126,0:23:09,0:23:28,SPEAKER 1," Here's, I mean, so I think we've solved it for you as the good news, Lauren, you need  to purchase 25 cents worth of chocolate milk, stomp on it and wait for the positive results. "
127,0:23:28,0:23:46,SPEAKER 2," The school teachers and administrators then had to talk to me as if I was the one who  had caused the ruckus because I had stomped on a 25 cent chocolate milk and made a mess.  And then I had to explain the situation, but nobody was truly at fault. "
128,0:23:46,0:23:47,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
129,0:23:47,0:23:53,SPEAKER 2," I mean, obviously, no, like they didn't, they didn't want the milk to get stomped. "
130,0:23:53,0:23:54,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
131,0:23:54,0:24:01,SPEAKER 2," So no one was at fault.  It was just a situation, though it did begin with bullying, so they shouldn't have done "
132,0:24:01,0:24:03,SPEAKER 1, that.  Yeah. 
133,0:24:03,0:24:04,SPEAKER 2," This is not, it's not working. "
134,0:24:04,0:25:08,SPEAKER 1," The next question comes from Mary Kate who writes, dear John and Hank, that might be the  worst answer I've ever heard to a question you asked.  I didn't ask it.  A question I asked, just love, love, and follow your heart, but don't drop out of law  school.  Next one comes from Mary Kate who writes, dear John and Hank, I'm over the moon excited  to get married in July, but I'm in a bit of a pickle.  Oh, I just read on, it's not a literal pickle, unfortunately.  I feel out of that habit.  That would have been amazing.  I've been in a previous question.  I've been in a bit of a pickle.  How do I get out of this pickle to get married?  That's it.  Burns.  He on say reports that he's not on a married pickle.  I recently accidentally came across an intel that my mom had been planning a surprise  for me at my wedding.  I'm a huge fan of surprises.  Oh, okay.  This one is a bit much.  She intended to have a live owl fly our rings to us at the ceremony.  No.  I understand. "
135,0:25:08,0:25:26,SPEAKER 2," I understand the impulse, but you're just like, if you don't know this is going to happen,  you're going to be like, oh God, giant bird attack.  Who doesn't think who thinks, oh, what a nice surprise.  No, you think we're being attacked by a bird. "
136,0:25:26,0:26:33,SPEAKER 1," You know, Hank, every year or two, somebody does die from an owl attack.  What?  Google it.  Google it while I'm reading the rest of the question.  I know she has this idea out of thoughtfulness and love.  I'm a big potter fan.  That doesn't, you know what?  Like, I read those books and at no point does an owl carry wedding rings into a wedding  ceremony.  But anyway, this is clearly a no good, terrible idea in so many ways.  Here's the issue.  I was told this information by someone close to me because my mom wasn't able to make  this happen.  Really?  That's a big surprise.  Yeah, that good.  Excellent.  But they also said that my mom said, guess I'll just have to come up with a different plan.  I'm not supposed to know about the owl situation in the first place, but what if my mom tries  to bring a different species of animal to carry rings at my wedding?  My question is this, do I tell my mom I don't want any avian beings at my wedding or do  I trust her to make a reasonable surprise?  Quite contrary, Mary Kate.  I mean, do you know the story about almost definitely the murder? "
137,0:26:33,0:26:37,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, no, I was going to talk about chocolate milk. "
138,0:26:37,0:26:51,SPEAKER 1," Oh, I thought we were still talking about the owl murder.  But can we let go of the chocolate milk thing because it was never a good bit and now it's  been going on way too long.  But you know what was a great bit?  The pickle?  The plums.  Yeah, the pickle.  Okay. "
139,0:26:51,0:26:56,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, I did look up the owl murder and I'm a little confused. "
140,0:26:56,0:26:57,SPEAKER 1, Don't you? 
141,0:26:57,0:27:00,SPEAKER 2, I'm not entirely 100% sure that the owl did it. 
142,0:27:00,0:27:07,SPEAKER 1," Oh, it is very controversial because you mean because the accused human killer probably "
143,0:27:07,0:27:09,SPEAKER 2," killed, may have killed the person. "
144,0:27:09,0:27:30,SPEAKER 1," Previous spouse.  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's an argument to made that it might not have been an owl, but there's also  an argument to be made that it wasn't an owl.  Who knows?  For sure.  All we know for certain Hank is that Mary Kate is in quite a pickle.  Here's the thing, Mary Kate, what if you go to your wedding in a pickle? "
145,0:27:30,0:27:50,SPEAKER 2," Wait, but I think so my feeling is if you know that there's going to be a bird, that it's  okay for there to be a bird, right?  So you know now that if a bird attacks you, it's just the ring bearer. "
146,0:27:50,0:28:13,SPEAKER 1," It's part of the plan, but I mean, who wants to try to like wrestle a wedding ring from  the talons of a bird, but it's very well trained bird.  Okay.  Guess what?  Just have to come up with a different plan.  That's the direct quote from Mary Kate's mom.  It doesn't say that it's going to be a bird.  It could be a whale, that whale could be a walk-in ring bear. "
147,0:28:14,0:28:17,SPEAKER 2, A ring bearer.  Ring bearer. 
148,0:28:17,0:28:24,SPEAKER 1," A ring bearer.  Oh my God.  Mary Kate, your mom is going to hire a panda to come to your wedding. "
149,0:28:24,0:28:29,SPEAKER 2," I hope it's a galal, if it's going to be a non bear bearer. "
150,0:28:29,0:28:35,SPEAKER 1," Walk with me here.  Yeah.  So the bear obviously isn't going to be able to hold the wedding rings, right?  Yeah.  What's it going to do? "
151,0:28:35,0:28:38,SPEAKER 2," Well, I think I should just strap it to him. "
152,0:28:38,0:28:56,SPEAKER 1," Wrong.  Dead wrong.  Right, like three hours before the wedding.  You feed the koala two wedding rings.  And then right, and then the koala walks down the aisle, the boobs, how they come, you dig  them out of the koala poop. "
153,0:28:56,0:29:01,SPEAKER 2, And it's like that like extra awesome coffee that's been through the digestive system 
154,0:29:01,0:29:14,SPEAKER 1," of a cat or whatever.  Exactly.  So that's your wedding ring.  Yes.  With this ring, I thee wed.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's it, Hank.  It's all that maricate.  Tell your mom to hire a koala to pick the wedding rings. "
155,0:29:14,0:29:17,SPEAKER 2," But make sure you know a good amount about koala digestion, because I think that might be "
156,0:29:17,0:29:18,SPEAKER 1, real slow. 
157,0:29:18,0:29:21,SPEAKER 2, And so you might have to feed it to him like a few days ago. 
158,0:29:21,0:30:20,SPEAKER 1," You might have like a four day wedding.  We got to have a weird wedding traditions in America, but we don't have that particular  one.  Yeah.  You feed a koala to wedding rings.  And then the wedding lasts until the koala poops, and sometimes it's just like a ten-minute  wedding.  And then other days it's like a six week wedding, you know?  Oh, man.  This is just to say I retweeted the plums that were in the ice box tweet, which you have  probably already seen.  Forgive me.  Nice.  That's good.  It's got it.  It's it.  It had a surprise ending.  Hank, we're going to answer one more question before we get to the all important news from  Mars and the F.C. Wimbledon.  Okay.  But first, I have to let you know that today's this is the Christmas episode.  Yes.  It's brought to you by koala poop, koala poop, the future of weddings. "
159,0:30:20,0:30:24,SPEAKER 2, This podcast is also brought to you by really bad print songs. 
160,0:30:24,0:30:33,SPEAKER 1, Really bad print songs.  They don't exist.  And of course today's podcast is brought to you by the plums that were in the ice box  no longer.  No longer. 
161,0:30:33,0:30:38,SPEAKER 2, Not thorny.  And this podcast is finally brought to you by aged gatorade. 
162,0:30:38,0:30:39,SPEAKER 1, Hmm. 
163,0:30:39,0:30:43,SPEAKER 2," Been sitting on that shelf there for seven days, getting slightly sweeter so that John "
164,0:30:43,0:31:29,SPEAKER 1," can like it the way that he likes it.  That's right.  So delicious and so cold.  Hank.  Do you have John?  Before we get to the news from Mars and the F.C. Wimbledon, I want to just clear a couple  of things.  I have a couple of corrections to give.  I've been gone for like a month because of my vertigo.  But before I left, I said that Facebook might be listening to everything that we say through  our phones.  I was kidding, but lots of people took that seriously Facebook.  It's not listening to everything we say through our phones.  They get plenty of data just from what we choose to give them.  And I apologize if that wasn't clear.  Also one other thing.  Sierra wrote in, hey, you may remember in a previous episode of the podcast there was a young  person who was trying to figure out how to take their secret pet snake with them to college.  Right. "
165,0:31:29,0:31:39,SPEAKER 2," The parent was like, you can't have a snake.  They got one anyway.  Hit the snake for more than a year.  And then had to go to college, but didn't want parents to find out about the secret snake. "
166,0:31:39,0:32:11,SPEAKER 1," Update.  Sierra writes, dear John and Hank, I'm a freshman in college and one of my greatest fears  has recently been made a reality and it's all your fault.  There is a snake loose in my dorm.  Wait, is it?  Is it all our fault?  Apparently one of the residents had a secret pet snake in her dorm room and now it is  loose wandering the halls ready to ruin my life.  I can't help but assume that someone in my dorm is a fan of the pod and has listened  to your ludicrous advice regarding secret snakes.  And because of that, there is a snake roaming the halls of my building.  This is more of a complaint than a question.  Sierra. "
167,0:32:11,0:32:31,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, there's dear Centennial residents, housing and residential life staff recently learned  that a resident in Centennial Hall had an unauthorized pet snake in their room.  The pet snake escaped this resident's room.  We're currently writing to notify you about this and assure you that this snake does  not pose a physical threat to anyone in the building. "
168,0:32:31,0:32:33,SPEAKER 1, A psychic threat. 
169,0:32:33,0:32:41,SPEAKER 2," Yes, an existential threat maybe, but not a physical threat. "
170,0:32:41,0:34:01,SPEAKER 1," The coldest of all comforts.  Right?  Yeah.  No.  You don't worry.  The bear that we've set loose in your dorm has been de-clawed.  It's so.  They're very docile.  Doesn't pose a physical threat.  Doesn't pose a physical threat.  All right.  It has been fed two wedding rings in any minute now.  All right.  This last thing comes from Sarah who says, why are you cutting down honey suckle?  It is super sweet and lovely.  If you eat it, please, it will change your life.  Google how to eat honey suckle.  Here's the thing Sarah, before my vertigo, but after I got home from the turtles all the  way down to her, I spent several weeks cutting honey suckle out of my backyard while building  this path that was partly a metaphor, but also like a thing that took 90 hours of my life.  And honey suckle is an invasive plant and it is a disaster to natural Indiana plants.  And the reason I was cutting it out is so that we could have some sweet, regular, homemade  Indiana shrubbery, not gross, stupid honey suckle.  So I don't care how good the juice from the flowers taste.  It is an invasive weed except it's tree-sized. "
171,0:34:01,0:34:11,SPEAKER 2, Could we like harness it and maybe people would want it so bad that we'd over harvest it  and all be gone? 
172,0:34:11,0:34:12,SPEAKER 1, Because apparently it's pretty good. 
173,0:34:12,0:34:13,SPEAKER 2, I've had honey suckle. 
174,0:34:13,0:34:34,SPEAKER 1," It's tasty.  No.  We can't.  That's a good idea, Hank, because humans are traditionally good at over harvesting anything  that we like, but we literally cannot like honey suckle enough to get rid of all of it.  I could spend the rest of my life cutting honey suckle.  It's pretty hard.  I'm like, it seems like a bit of a typical thing to like bottle like one bud and then you "
175,0:34:34,0:34:41,SPEAKER 2," suck it out and spit it into the bottle and then one and it's going to take a long time  and you can, I mean, geter it is available at stores. "
176,0:34:41,0:35:27,SPEAKER 1," All right, Hank.  This last question comes from Emma who writes, dear John and Hank, I was confronted at work  yesterday evening with my first official get well card signing.  I waffled and I found myself at a loss for what to write.  I waffled between ideas for a solid five minutes and before setting on a short, unfeeling  get well soon.  I can't help but feel like a horribly unsympathetic person for not thinking of anything else, but  it is for a coworker and all.  So anything more emotional just seemed weird.  What the heck is one supposed to write in a get well card?  It feels like signing yearbooks when you write something repetitive and codified that  is totally disconnected from any of your genuine feelings.  Also, I can't help but feel like telling someone to get well soon is rather insensitive  since it's not usually up to them whether they get well soon or not.  It's just like, it's a great point. "
177,0:35:27,0:35:30,SPEAKER 2," Why are you telling like, can you get that in order? "
178,0:35:30,0:36:50,SPEAKER 1," I already had that idea.  It's like, oh my god, until I read your card and hadn't crossed my mind to get better  about that.  That's weird.  Yeah, I hope you get well soon.  I hope you are.  Yes.  I work with a lot of elderly people, so I'm afraid this will slowly become a more pressing  issue.  Please help with my deal, Emma with Mondale because she's in a pickle, but also she's in  a pickle.  You just got it.  There you go.  There you go.  Thank you.  All right.  Emma, this is a great question.  I thought I was a different girl.  I recently got a get well card from all the people at our office because of the incapaciting  vertigo that I had, and I don't want to criticize anybody because we've worked with very  many nice people, but some of them said get well soon to which my reaction was, I already  thought of that.  I've already tried that strategy.  It did not work, and here I am still not well less soon than I would want.  The one that I liked the most, the one that I found the most helpful personally was,  I hope you feel better.  I hope you feel better is good because it's like never not true.  Even when you're good, I hope you feel better.  Yeah.  Right. "
179,0:36:50,0:36:52,SPEAKER 2, I hope you feel better than you feel right now. 
180,0:36:52,0:37:05,SPEAKER 1," Did you see Mike, you feel pretty good?  I do, but I could feel better.  Right.  I hope I do soon.  I hope I feel better soon.  Yeah.  I hope you feel better soon.  It is a universal lift up. "
181,0:37:05,0:37:07,SPEAKER 2," And you're never, yeah, you're never feeling all the way. "
182,0:37:07,0:37:08,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
183,0:37:08,0:37:11,SPEAKER 2, Sometimes I think people don't need to feel better than they're currently feeling. 
184,0:37:11,0:37:16,SPEAKER 1," Another strategy, Emma, you need to feel a little worse than you're feeling right now. "
185,0:37:16,0:37:20,SPEAKER 2," Maybe.  That's the case, not almost never, but occasionally. "
186,0:37:20,0:37:37,SPEAKER 1," Another thing that Emma could do since she knows that she works with a lot of elderly  people is she could write,  I understand that you are an elderly person and this will probably become more and more  of an issue as time goes on.  I don't know if that would be an incentive. "
187,0:37:37,0:37:40,SPEAKER 2, And I hope that you feel better soon. 
188,0:37:40,0:37:45,SPEAKER 1," But likely, this will continue to be a problem. "
189,0:37:45,0:38:00,SPEAKER 2," If it's not too bad of a vanilla list, I would draw fish, sure.  And then I draw a little line, comes out of the fish's butt, and then it says, poot. "
190,0:38:00,0:38:10,SPEAKER 1," That's the, that's the whole thing.  That's it.  Man, I haven't, I haven't heard a story that good since the milk story.  The milk story is great. "
191,0:38:10,0:38:12,SPEAKER 2, That's such a good story. 
192,0:38:12,0:38:13,SPEAKER 1, What is the news for Mars? 
193,0:38:13,0:38:15,SPEAKER 2, Maybe it was a little misplaced. 
194,0:38:15,0:38:17,SPEAKER 1, What is the news for Mars?  NASA. 
195,0:38:17,0:38:18,SPEAKER 2, Yep. 
196,0:38:18,0:38:20,SPEAKER 1, You've heard of them.  They're great. 
197,0:38:20,0:38:32,SPEAKER 2," Are working on the next generation Curiosity rover thing, Mars 2020 rover.  And you may have heard that Curiosity's wheels are not great shape. "
198,0:38:32,0:38:42,SPEAKER 1," Oh yeah, it's a big problem.  Yeah.  So I've actually got to start driving Curiosity backward to try to get like the tread  worn on the other side.  Basically, yeah. "
199,0:38:42,0:39:49,SPEAKER 2," Well yeah, like the first wheels hit the rocks first, you know.  Yeah, I get it.  And so NASA is working on new wheel designs.  And they have just let people know about this cool flexible chainmail wheel that's made  out of chains.  Now, that's going to give us the traction we need, but also the flexibility and the durability  that you want in a wheel that's going to be driving around on the surface of Mars for  you know, hopefully five, maybe even 10 years with the mission like this.  This wheel, I believe it uses, okay, so yeah, it's a nickel titanium shape memory alloy.  Such alloys remember their original shape and spring back immediately after deforming,  meaning they retain their original shape and performance.  So it's a cool, a cool new wheel design coming out of NASA to make Curiosity's new cousins  more durable and long-lasting. "
200,0:39:49,0:41:14,SPEAKER 1," No, it's exciting, but not as maybe not as exciting as the AFC Wimbledon, duh, duh, duh, duh!  Hank, so AFC Wimbledon played, I think, I can't remember who, I think Charlton in the  second round of the FA Cup.  The FA Cup is this competition in England where for the first two rounds teams from  the lower leagues play each other.  And then if they can make it to the third round of the FA Cup, that's when the premier league  teams and the teams from the second tier in England, the championship come in, okay?  So like a few years ago, you might remember that AFC Wimbledon made it to the third round  of the FA Cup and they played Liverpool.  Remember?  And I was very, very difficult for me because I grew up a Liverpool fan and I was like,  but they're not going to be Liverpool, so I mean, indeed, they didn't, they lost two  one.  But they played Liverpool at home, which is great because it's like a big club and they  come and it's on TV and everything, but it wouldn't have been, it's not as good as if  we'd played Liverpool at Liverpool.  And do you know why that is?  Because the Liverpool sells more tickets, 60,000 tickets as opposed to AFC Wimbledon Stadium  which sells out at 4,800.  What if I told you that the third round of the FA Cup, Wimbledon made it to the third  round of the FA Cup, thanks to a goal scored by the Montserrati and Messi Lyle Taylor,  the resurgent Lyle Taylor.  This has been in quite a while.  Yeah. "
201,0:41:14,0:41:15,SPEAKER 2, He's on fire. 
202,0:41:15,0:42:39,SPEAKER 1," Got rid of those frosted tips.  Still has the frosted tips, so nobody's perfect.  So they made it to the third round of the FA Cup.  They could have drawn any team.  They could have drawn Swindon.  They could have drawn the franchise currently, applying its trade in Milton Keynes, but they  drew the best possible draw, Tottenham away, which means that they are going to play at  Wembley, the national stadium because Tottenham is currently building a stadium.  So they're playing this season at Wembley, the place where they won the league two playoff  to go to league one.  Dad was there.  My friend Stewart was there.  You were unable to attend.  Rosiana was there.  It was magical.  You would have had a great time.  I don't know what you're doing.  Parenting or something.  So they're going to play at Wembley in the third round of the FA Cup against Tottenham.  And here's the great thing, Hank.  Two things.  First off, AFC Wembleyden has never lost a game at Wembley, ever, ever.  They played two, and they won them both.  So first off, we're probably going to win.  Secondly, even if we don't win, it is so much money.  One game against Tottenham is so much money, like we might stay up entirely because we  happen to draw Tottenham away. "
203,0:42:39,0:42:40,SPEAKER 2, So you're going to spend this money immediately. 
204,0:42:40,0:43:30,SPEAKER 1," I would hope so.  You're going to be like, hey, hot shot, 22-year-old, more likely like, hey, last guy on Tottenham's  bench.  If you want to spend the last three months of the season on loan in South London, and  he'll be like, yeah, of course I do.  Great.  Come on, man.  We can afford your wages for three months.  So it's very, it's incredible.  It's funny.  Sometimes in football, results matter, and sometimes in football, you just have to pull  Tottenham away in the third round of the FA Cup.  And if we win or tie, that would be amazing.  But it also doesn't matter.  Yeah.  If we lose, also amazing.  If you win, everybody, everybody good at the game, get a ticket, get a ticket. "
205,0:43:30,0:43:31,SPEAKER 2, Is it going to sell out? 
206,0:43:31,0:43:47,SPEAKER 1," I don't probably not.  Probably not.  It's Tottenham fans.  Get tickets to the hot, hot third round of the FA Cup.  It's probably the only time you'll play AFC Wimbledon ever.  Don't miss this opportunity, Tottenham.  It's incredibly exciting. "
207,0:43:47,0:43:50,SPEAKER 2," We said ever at the same time, and then we giggled the same, and I'm uncomfortable. "
208,0:43:50,0:45:35,SPEAKER 1," Well, the last thing I wanted to say just before we close the podcast downhank is that,  you know my favorite character from the DC Universe?  Yeah.  Paul Manafort.  It's like really familiar with him.  It's really good joke.  Yeah.  It's good.  People say like all the DC universes in that group, like, well, Paul Manafort is an amazing  story.  Like, you can't write this crap.  Paul Manafort just had his bail revoked.  What does that mean?  He was on, he was out on bail because he's been charged with conspiracy against the United  States.  Yeah.  He was out on bail.  What do you do?  He just has bail revoked because he's been working with a Russian spy while under house  arrest.  What?  On an op ed piece about why we should have better relationships with the Russians.  What?  Yes, so they revoked his bail.  I mean, this DC Universe stuff is so amazing, Hank.  What's happening in DC Universe right now?  The Justice League stuff is great.  You got the Mueller on the one side.  You got the crazy Manafort on the other side with his three passwords and his password  through his email being bombed 007.  It's gold, gold, gold, gold.  I just want to congratulate the writers of the weird timeline in which we found ourselves.  This is great.  This is great stuff.  I'm recording this in the past, by the way.  So if in the interim, the president has resigned and or fired the special counsel and or whatever,  it's gold.  It's all gold.  It's terrible.  It's awful.  I hate myself for paying attention to it, but it's also gold.  Hank, thank you for popping with me.  Yes, John. "
209,0:45:35,0:45:36,SPEAKER 2, Yes. 
210,0:45:36,0:45:37,SPEAKER 1, What did we learn today? 
211,0:45:37,0:45:38,SPEAKER 2, Very little. 
212,0:45:38,0:45:48,SPEAKER 1, We learned that the milk story isn't very good.  We learned that it certainly wasn't placed in the proper place.  We learned that the plums that were in the ice box were both delicious and cold and we 
213,0:45:48,0:45:52,SPEAKER 2, learned that AFC Wimbledon has never lost a game at Wimbly or at least I learned that. 
214,0:45:52,0:46:34,SPEAKER 1," Not yet.  When's that game happen?  January 6th or 7th or 5th.  I can't go because my friend in Rico is turning 40 and I called my wife and I said do  I have to go to it in Rico's birthday party and she said yes and then I called in Rico  and I was like do you want to go to London with me?  He said he said I can't because my wife will get mad because I'm turning 40.  So I can't go to the game.  I'm kind of annoyed about it.  I'm still thinking maybe what if I flew his wife over there too.  That's good.  All right, John.  Thanks for popping with me.  This podcast is edited by Nicholas Jenkins. "
