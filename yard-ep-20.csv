0,0:00:01,0:00:03,SPEAKER 2," Ludwig, are you peeing or are you pooping? "
1,0:00:05,0:00:07,SPEAKER 1, Are you peeing or are you pooping? 
2,0:00:16,0:00:21,SPEAKER 3," So Aiden, so looking at Ludwig's fish shoes, Ludwig, you're gonna lift your feet up for it. "
3,0:00:21,0:00:22,SPEAKER 1, You guys wanna see something? No. 
4,0:00:22,0:00:23,SPEAKER 3," Oh, I'm trying to- "
5,0:00:24,0:00:25,SPEAKER 1, Flash his balls? 
6,0:00:25,0:00:28,SPEAKER 2," Don't you just flash your balls?  Oh, man.  I missed it. "
7,0:00:28,0:00:30,SPEAKER 3, Archie has to look at that. 
8,0:00:30,0:00:31,SPEAKER 1, I have a good angle on my camera. 
9,0:00:31,0:00:33,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, that's-  Well, I think one of the hands- "
10,0:00:33,0:00:35,SPEAKER 1, It definitely is. 
11,0:00:35,0:00:38,SPEAKER 3, Footage of your balls now exists out of our hands. 
12,0:00:38,0:00:39,SPEAKER 2, That's right. 
13,0:00:39,0:00:40,SPEAKER 1, Do you want an Archie's hand? 
14,0:00:40,0:00:43,SPEAKER 3, In Archie's hands to destroy you if he wants. 
15,0:00:43,0:00:44,SPEAKER 2, I don't think it destroys him. 
16,0:00:44,0:00:47,SPEAKER 4," You know, I'm a game controller molded after my balls. "
17,0:00:47,0:00:48,SPEAKER 2, They're not your balls. 
18,0:00:48,0:00:55,SPEAKER 4," I said sickenasty, 13 pictures,  a full panoramic video of my balls to model that out here. "
19,0:00:55,0:00:58,SPEAKER 2," You can import this into blender.  Yeah, enjoy. "
20,0:00:58,0:01:00,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, it can be in video games now, my balls. "
21,0:01:00,0:01:19,SPEAKER 1," I did like that controller  and how much it made the rounds.  Because I got sent the picture and like the concept  such a long time ago that I forgot about it.  Sickenasty made this as an award  for that among us tournament he hosted.  Like literally a year ago.  It was, it's well over here. "
22,0:01:19,0:01:21,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, we didn't live here. "
23,0:01:21,0:01:22,SPEAKER 4, It was like 18 months ago. 
24,0:01:22,0:01:29,SPEAKER 1," And he said like,  oh, a lot of we thought this would be-  this would be funny if I made this.  The actual conversation was like this. "
25,0:01:29,0:01:38,SPEAKER 4," I win the tournament.  He goes, hey, so like the words like a controller  because I made controllers.  What controller do you want?  And me, because I was like,  I don't give a fuck about a controller.  I just got my Nez mod guy. "
26,0:01:38,0:01:39,SPEAKER 2, You're a bit of a bad boy. 
27,0:01:39,0:01:45,SPEAKER 4," I said, give me a dick in ball controller.  And he goes, what?  And then I never reply. "
28,0:01:45,0:01:51,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, it's like a young link going like,  what, what?  And then adult link a year later and it's sickenasty  and he's like, what's up? "
29,0:01:51,0:01:53,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, and then he became alpha. "
30,0:01:53,0:02:06,SPEAKER 1," He messaged me and I think maybe Anthony's well  and he's like, okay,  so Ludwig sent this and then sent nothing else  when I responded.  So do you think this is okay to make?  And I said, probably, "
31,0:02:07,0:02:18,SPEAKER 2," let's talk about, I love deferring to Aiden.  The fucking, the worst king of the squares ever.  But before we do that, welcome to the yard.  We haven't really gave a proper- "
32,0:02:18,0:02:19,SPEAKER 3, Welcome to the goddamn- 
33,0:02:19,0:02:20,SPEAKER 1, Bring in. 
34,0:02:20,0:02:22,SPEAKER 4," Hey, what's up, Mr. Tenke? "
35,0:02:22,0:02:27,SPEAKER 1," Hello?  Hello, Tenke.  Hey, Tenke is all around.  If you touch your balls, Tenke is all around. "
36,0:02:27,0:02:29,SPEAKER 2," With that hand, that you just touch. "
37,0:02:29,0:02:30,SPEAKER 4," No, I didn't. "
38,0:02:30,0:02:33,SPEAKER 3," Don't look at the camera.  Don't, don't gin from that office us. "
39,0:02:33,0:02:34,SPEAKER 1," No, I didn't touch those balls. "
40,0:02:34,0:02:36,SPEAKER 3, Just look at us.  Don't look at the camera. 
41,0:02:36,0:02:37,SPEAKER 1," Stop it, you fuck you. "
42,0:02:37,0:02:38,SPEAKER 2," Stop it, you fuck you. "
43,0:02:38,0:02:39,SPEAKER 3, You motherfucker. 
44,0:02:39,0:02:44,SPEAKER 2," I've, you know what?  Good stuff.  Salty, I felt the salt on him. "
45,0:02:44,0:02:44,SPEAKER 1, A little salt on him. 
46,0:02:44,0:02:45,SPEAKER 2, I traded my fingers. 
47,0:02:45,0:02:46,SPEAKER 1, Do that. 
48,0:02:46,0:03:06,SPEAKER 3," That, uh, that ball.  So we are at main stage this weekend  and uh, which is a smash tournament  and that ball sack controller.  So sickenasty comes up to me.  I don't know it's him at the time.  He just comes up and says, can I show you something?  No context.  He's not.  I should do some self.  And I said, yes.  And then he pulls out the controller balls first  and points them at me. "
49,0:03:06,0:03:08,SPEAKER 2," You're like, dude, no, no. "
50,0:03:08,0:03:10,SPEAKER 3," And I literally went, dude. "
51,0:03:11,0:03:12,SPEAKER 2, Yes. 
52,0:03:12,0:03:22,SPEAKER 3," And I held it.  And I started laughing.  And I'm like, has slime seen this yet?  He's like, no, I'm like, you have to go show.  Yeah, do not contact.  Do what you just did to me.  Don't contextualize it.  Just go show him. "
53,0:03:22,0:03:23,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, the same thing.  I was like, yeah, sure. "
54,0:03:23,0:03:47,SPEAKER 3," I was like, yeah, I just like give me the controller.  I'll give it to him.  I'll make sure that we get it.  But I didn't have a controller at this event.  So the only one I had was this one.  So I'm like, well, I guess I'm going to go play  fucking friendlies.  So I go and I realize that I have Aidan's controller  like on me.  And I'm like, oh, I can go use that controller.  I go use that controller.  And I learn Aidan's controller is fucking terrible.  It's actually unreal that he uses it.  It's a miracle. "
55,0:03:47,0:03:48,SPEAKER 1, Mine is great. 
56,0:03:48,0:03:59,SPEAKER 3," But I sit down next to who I don't know is like a player  who's like seated like top of the event.  And we start playing and he's really good.  And I feel like I can't do anything.  And I'm like, oh, hold on.  I, uh, I'm like, hold on. "
57,0:03:59,0:04:01,SPEAKER 2, I pull out my main dish. 
58,0:04:01,0:04:12,SPEAKER 3," I'm like, hold on.  This isn't my controller.  Do you mind if I switch?  She's like, oh, no worries.  And so I pull out the balls.  And the port of the controller is the tip of a penis. "
59,0:04:12,0:04:13,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, the plug-in.  The doughs. "
60,0:04:13,0:04:24,SPEAKER 3," So I go like, it's so graphic.  So I just lift it up.  And he looks at it like, what the fuck is that?  And I'm like, this is my main.  And I plug it in.  And I play way better. "
61,0:04:24,0:04:25,SPEAKER 4, You start dusting him. 
62,0:04:25,0:04:26,SPEAKER 1, I can start. 
63,0:04:26,0:04:32,SPEAKER 2," I started saying, it's a really nice controller.  That's why it's a good controller.  It's like, bro, feel that shit.  Yeah, that's a good controller. "
64,0:04:32,0:04:36,SPEAKER 4, You know what's funny is there are certain setups  you can't use a controller on. 
65,0:04:36,0:04:37,SPEAKER 3, What do you mean? 
66,0:04:37,0:04:40,SPEAKER 1," Oh, yeah.  You can't hop on the sticks with mommy behind the sun "
67,0:04:40,0:04:41,SPEAKER 4, at this first turn. 
68,0:04:41,0:04:41,SPEAKER 1," Oh, yeah. "
69,0:04:41,0:04:45,SPEAKER 2," Also, baby smashers.  Smash sisters like setup. "
70,0:04:45,0:04:48,SPEAKER 3," Also, when you can't play somebody that one. "
71,0:04:48,0:04:49,SPEAKER 4," No, you need a controller? "
72,0:04:49,0:04:50,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, I got you. "
73,0:04:50,0:04:53,SPEAKER 2," It's like, she's like, actually, I don't need that. "
74,0:04:53,0:04:56,SPEAKER 4, Modeled after my own and then knocked the breath balls. 
75,0:04:56,0:05:05,SPEAKER 3," Also, when you're playing, you're like middle fingers,  depending on what you push triggers,  but like kind of touch them.  And it's like, it's so funny,  because you're just playing, you're like touching the balls. "
76,0:05:05,0:05:06,SPEAKER 4, They're so vany. 
77,0:05:06,0:05:08,SPEAKER 3," Oh my god, they're so realistic. "
78,0:05:08,0:05:11,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, I tried to use it to mash and it was not a vibe. "
79,0:05:11,0:05:12,SPEAKER 3, It was not a vibe. 
80,0:05:12,0:05:14,SPEAKER 4," It was way, you couldn't get a little lost. "
81,0:05:14,0:05:15,SPEAKER 2, It's it's counterbikes like a wheel. 
82,0:05:15,0:05:18,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, you got to put the counterbikes down at the front. "
83,0:05:18,0:05:27,SPEAKER 4," It's a running joke now though,  because like, occasionally,  just like I was doing a sponsor stream with Doritos.  And I go, I just lift up the controller from the balls  and I go, oh, check out my controller, guys. "
84,0:05:27,0:05:30,SPEAKER 1, But I don't show it.  I don't lift up. 
85,0:05:30,0:05:30,SPEAKER 2, That's hard. 
86,0:05:30,0:05:32,SPEAKER 4, So like half the people I know. 
87,0:05:32,0:05:59,SPEAKER 2," That's like, I'm my old job.  I used to make, I used to make some graphic stuff  like when our graphic designer was overloaded.  Like simple Photoshop stuff that would go around the venue.  And I think everyone who's worked in like corporate graphic  design has done this where they'll put like a very,  very faint transparent each of something, right?  And I would just like select different old people  from like Shutterstock.  And just just put them baby blended in the background. "
88,0:05:59,0:06:03,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, I forget if I told him on the podcast,  but what Dr. Noodle Slam did to dance. "
89,0:06:03,0:06:05,SPEAKER 2, You've told me before. 
90,0:06:05,0:06:09,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, so Dr. Noodle Slam who is in the yard discord, by the way. "
91,0:06:09,0:06:10,SPEAKER 3, He may as well be a member at this point. 
92,0:06:10,0:06:13,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, he comes up like a lot like a side character. "
93,0:06:13,0:06:15,SPEAKER 2, He's the null of Amon's life. 
94,0:06:15,0:06:17,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, he's like done through from friends. "
95,0:06:17,0:06:23,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, he's recurring enough.  Russian peace, but he's alive.  The doctor, well, nice. "
96,0:06:23,0:06:28,SPEAKER 2," Hey, you're like, you're like Jesus, bro.  Yeah, but I'm alive. "
97,0:06:28,0:06:31,SPEAKER 4," I did everything he did, but I'm still here. "
98,0:06:31,0:07:00,SPEAKER 1," And he, he in our last year in college,  he decided to volunteer after getting sort of like,  talked into it to be the graphic designer for Dance Marathon,  which is like a charity event that happens every year.  At the University of Washington and Seattle, you.  And they like, sometimes they work together on it,  and sometimes they like compete.  But that year he got talked into doing graphic design,  because it's, which is funny, because he only does it as like a hobby.  He isn't like, by the way, also the guy who made ever dream this man. "
99,0:07:00,0:07:02,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, legend here. "
100,0:07:02,0:07:02,SPEAKER 2, Yeah. 
101,0:07:02,0:07:12,SPEAKER 1," And he he starts working on this.  He's like, dude, this is crazy.  Like they weren't even using Photoshop before.  They were putting together images in Google Slides. "
102,0:07:12,0:07:13,SPEAKER 2," That's right.  Yeah, Google Slides. "
103,0:07:13,0:07:16,SPEAKER 1," They were putting stuff together in Google Slides.  Like, this is how bad the club was. "
104,0:07:16,0:07:17,SPEAKER 2," No, it's easy.  You can move it around really. "
105,0:07:17,0:07:18,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
106,0:07:18,0:07:19,SPEAKER 2, There's a little pop. 
107,0:07:19,0:07:21,SPEAKER 4, You can just move that you make shapes with the image button. 
108,0:07:21,0:07:21,SPEAKER 2, Yeah. 
109,0:07:21,0:07:22,SPEAKER 1," Oh, dude. "
110,0:07:22,0:07:26,SPEAKER 3," And when I do it on my computer,  your computer also sees it at the same time. "
111,0:07:26,0:07:56,SPEAKER 1," It's a great feature.  And he puts together a banner for like the Facebook event  and like the promo and stuff.  And he's like, take a look at it.  He sends me an image on on Facebook.  And he's like, you see it?  I'm looking real close.  Oh, my God.  And at like 10% opacity,  he has put a picture of Danny DeVito hanging himself  in the banner for this charity  for Seattle Children's Hospital. "
112,0:07:59,0:08:00,SPEAKER 3, That's cool. 
113,0:08:00,0:08:14,SPEAKER 1," And no one ever found out.  No one ever noticed because he posted it.  He posted it in the group chat of like 20 plus people.  And he's like, is this good?  And everybody's like, yeah, it looks great. "
114,0:08:14,0:08:18,SPEAKER 4, Like she has to drop the opacity from sending it  to you to sending it to the group chat. 
115,0:08:18,0:08:20,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, I don't think he full committed 10%.  I don't think so. "
116,0:08:20,0:08:23,SPEAKER 2," Damn, if you still have it,  send it to one of us. "
117,0:08:23,0:09:09,SPEAKER 3," On the topic of have you seen this man recently  me and Aiden needed this graphic for it.  Undisclosed yard project.  I won't talk about.  But I was telling Aiden,  like, oh, I really need the have you ever seen?  Have you ever dreamed this man Aiden faced?  Can you send it to me?  And he's like, yeah, yeah.  And I'm like, he's like a Sam is going to see  if he like still has the file, whatever.  I'm like, oh, I'm impressed that he would still have the file  because you know, he made it so long ago.  And it's like, oh, it's only like two months.  And I'm like, you only made it two months ago.  I thought it was years ago.  And he's like, oh, yeah, he's like,  he's like, no, he made it like two months ago.  And I'm like, I'm like certain.  I saw it two months ago.  And then it hit me.  I was like, you dreamed the man.  I was like, oh, no, no, what if I've literally dreamed this man? "
118,0:09:10,0:09:12,SPEAKER 2, Did you miss the website? 
119,0:09:12,0:09:14,SPEAKER 1," Dude, you should. "
120,0:09:14,0:09:21,SPEAKER 3," I was fucking so scared.  I was like, I literally had this like visceral feeling  that I saw this meme like a long time ago. "
121,0:09:21,0:09:22,SPEAKER 2, Of Aiman's face? 
122,0:09:22,0:09:24,SPEAKER 3, Of Aiman's face. 
123,0:09:24,0:09:25,SPEAKER 2, Not the regular man's face. 
124,0:09:25,0:09:36,SPEAKER 3," Not the regular one.  And I was so certain.  Like I even like said in like a public chat,  like, oh, this was made years ago.  So I don't know if we can get it.  And then when he told me it was two months,  I was like so shocked.  I was so certain. "
125,0:09:36,0:09:40,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, you got siopped by the dream.  I did. "
126,0:09:40,0:09:54,SPEAKER 1," I told him that was like, yeah, he made that a couple of months ago,  but he he's done this for a long time.  Like he'll just what sometimes he'll get like in the zone.  And like he'll spend like a couple hours on a photoshop  that like makes fun of me.  And he's done this for like years. "
127,0:09:54,0:09:58,SPEAKER 2," I've done this too a lot.  Like I used to do it like big victor, be money.  Like I used to. "
128,0:09:58,0:10:00,SPEAKER 4, High-firt photoshop roasts. 
129,0:10:00,0:10:48,SPEAKER 2," Or not even photoshop.  One time for a for in SoCal melee.  There was a there was a beef between a T.O.  and the crimson blur.  And I had so like that T.O. ran a tournament very badly.  The crimson blur had not like really been involved in SoCal T.O.  and like add all up to this point,  but everyone kind of thought he was.  So I basically spent all night in Premiere  doing this very terribly key framing this T.O.'s face  and Blur's face on two characters from the wire  where it's fruit and Marlow to gangsters.  And Marlow's like the leader and and fruits like sorry man.  I don't know what's going on.  He's like yeah well someone disrespects me.  Damn short this something about it.  And like and I made this whole shit post.  I stayed up like five in the morning posted it for like 50 likes. "
130,0:10:48,0:10:52,SPEAKER 4, And you know the difference between us is I did the same thing  but for I miss the old mango. 
131,0:10:52,0:10:58,SPEAKER 2, Yeah you've always been a marketer.  Yeah you just oh what about what about you got a box in me.  We all love that one. 
132,0:10:58,0:11:04,SPEAKER 4, I did it for that too.  You make fun of you would got a box me.  That is one of a trilogy of songs I did. 
133,0:11:04,0:11:22,SPEAKER 2, Ludwig I talk about this a lot there I think.  He was so excited when he made you got a box in me.  It's like it's like it's the trilogy.  It's the trilogy.  It's like the musical and we're like we just roast this shit out of him.  I actually felt bad because he was like oh he really thought this was hype.  And every every one of his friends was like dude what do you do. 
134,0:11:22,0:11:36,SPEAKER 3, Hey bro you got a box in me is ill-matic  and then the Christmas song is like the Alvin Nas released this year.  It's like damn bruh I miss you got a box in it. 
135,0:11:36,0:11:38,SPEAKER 2, Hip hop heads.  That was the real hard part about him. 
136,0:11:38,0:11:42,SPEAKER 4, That's yeah when I become an artist that's what an art war comes up with. 
137,0:11:42,0:11:47,SPEAKER 2, Yeah Ludwig that I heard that you you were laughed and called cringe  for you got a bunch of new cringe right. 
138,0:11:47,0:11:49,SPEAKER 4, He's like a vinyl press of it.

143,0:12:04,0:12:08,SPEAKER 4, It's like a Carl's junior rapper in there.  I would be so honored. 
144,0:12:08,0:12:49,SPEAKER 2, Speaking of dreams I had a dream I dude I was so mad.  I woke up.  I had a dream where me aim it we're all in the car.  It was actually all of us.  And aiming is in the backseat and we're driving.  I'm driving and we see like this Lamborghini pull off the exit  and then flip.  Basically it takes like a turn too hard  and we're driving a little flip.  At the highway no it's like a deadly flip.  It's like and we're all watching holy shit dude.  And I'm driving and I'm like Amin can you uh can you call the cops?  And Amin was on his phone in the back and he's like no.  And I was so mad at him.  I'm like why?  He's like someone else will do it.  And I'm like what? 
145,0:12:49,0:12:54,SPEAKER 1, A cab.  A reasonable as cab. 
146,0:12:54,0:13:12,SPEAKER 2, And I was like and so the rest of the dream  was me like we got out of the car and I looked at him and I said  you're fucking I will never look at you the same bro.  I can't you actually are fucking psychopath and you were getting mad.  You're like no one was gonna call it like it doesn't matter  and we were just arguing.

163,0:13:56,0:13:57,SPEAKER 2, Why would you do that? 
164,0:13:57,0:13:59,SPEAKER 1, For that in that instance.  Let me continue. 
165,0:13:59,0:14:06,SPEAKER 4, So I give her the flowers.  She's like how much you spend like this is such a big bouquet.  I was like I was like $200 and she goes.  You got ripped off. 
166,0:14:07,0:14:09,SPEAKER 1, So I got flowers and I got.  Close it. 
167,0:14:09,0:14:12,SPEAKER 2, You know what she's got concussion brain.

169,0:14:12,0:14:17,SPEAKER 3, She's like to white in the episode of the office.  But he doesn't concussion no one knows.  She's just fucking throwing up. 
170,0:14:17,0:14:20,SPEAKER 4, She's like super loopy. 
171,0:14:21,0:14:22,SPEAKER 1, They just like are like he's weird today. 
172,0:14:22,0:14:25,SPEAKER 3, Maybe she wants a cat because she forgot about Ders. 
173,0:14:27,0:14:31,SPEAKER 2, I keep seeing this like gray blur when I'm walking around anyway.  I like cats.  Can we get one? 
174,0:14:31,0:14:32,SPEAKER 1, Can we get one? 
175,0:14:32,0:14:39,SPEAKER 4, Quick update we went to the the urgent care today  because she said headaches from the concussions  and the doc super chill doctor. 
176,0:14:40,0:14:41,SPEAKER 2, He's he's chill. 
177,0:14:41,0:14:44,SPEAKER 4, He was chill.  He's he's my dream blood rotation. 
178,0:14:44,0:14:49,SPEAKER 2, Yeah.  Yeah.  He puts ice in the bonk.  So he's urgent care doctor. 
179,0:14:49,0:14:52,SPEAKER 4, Take care doctor Sean Marionne and probably bill nine. 
180,0:14:52,0:14:55,SPEAKER 3, He takes the smelling salt off the doctor wall and just rips it. 
181,0:14:55,0:14:56,SPEAKER 2, Check this out. 
182,0:14:56,0:14:57,SPEAKER 1, I'm practicing. 
183,0:14:58,0:15:09,SPEAKER 4," But he's like a few weeks.  A few weeks of cutie having maybe brain fog, maybe concussed.  And so and so I'm proud to announce that I will be assisting in cooking  for friends giving this year.  I will be making one turkey. "
184,0:15:10,0:15:12,SPEAKER 3, Well wait this is because. 
185,0:15:13,0:15:13,SPEAKER 2, Why? 
186,0:15:13,0:15:19,SPEAKER 3, This is not unrelated to the concussion.  Let me understand it.  So she is still going to be cooking what you're helping. 
187,0:15:20,0:15:22,SPEAKER 4, I'll do one turkey to take a little off. 
188,0:15:22,0:15:24,SPEAKER 3, Also you decided you're still having her cook. 
189,0:15:24,0:15:32,SPEAKER 1, You decided.  Yeah I'm not going to do the whole fucking deal.  Well she's like a concussion.  You decided this before the doctor's appointment.  You told me you were going to cook a turkey last night.  You went to the doctor. 
190,0:15:32,0:15:37,SPEAKER 4, Also this is called content.  This is called looping in things together.  If you want to take a part of the whole sausage. 
191,0:15:37,0:15:41,SPEAKER 1, It doesn't make any sense though.  We'll take a part in the sausage.  We can take a part in the sausage. 
192,0:15:41,0:15:42,SPEAKER 2, We'll take a chill. 
193,0:15:42,0:16:03,SPEAKER 1," Oh we can't lie on the podcast now.  What's this not called?  Hold on.  When people get concussions, it's stuff like.  Don't look at screens for too long.  Don't focus in on text too hard.  You'll get headaches and things like that.  Nowhere in that is it.  Don't cook. "
194,0:16:03,0:16:07,SPEAKER 4, Actually it is.  It says you can't do anything that's too thought provoking at all.  It doesn't have to be things revolving.  It's your eyes. 
195,0:16:07,0:16:09,SPEAKER 2, Don't hurt your mind.  Literally. 
196,0:16:09,0:16:14,SPEAKER 4, He was literally like just take a brain vacation  and don't do things that make you think too much. 
197,0:16:14,0:16:14,SPEAKER 2, And then he did this. 
198,0:16:15,0:16:18,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.  She's like what? 
199,0:16:18,0:16:22,SPEAKER 3, And he's like into the audio book listeners.  They're smoking imaginary weed. 
200,0:16:23,0:16:33,SPEAKER 2, Dude wait.  Okay so by the way she makes a lot when she's so much food.  And the turkey I would argue you don't do much.  Right? 
201,0:16:33,0:16:37,SPEAKER 4, You got no she brines that 24 hours.  Cooke's it cars it. 
202,0:16:37,0:16:39,SPEAKER 1, I guess turkey's still a long time to cook. 
203,0:16:39,0:16:46,SPEAKER 4, No I'm going custom.  I watched the one Adam or Goosey video.  I'm going to become turkey guy now.  This is the guy who made me become pizza guy. 
204,0:16:46,0:16:53,SPEAKER 1, Is this going to be like the food equivalent  of you watching Adam Andrade do like a V9  and then you and then you rip your V2? 
205,0:16:53,0:16:59,SPEAKER 4, I'm actually a phenomenal climber.  And no it's not going to be seven par below Adam or Goosey.  I'm going to cook a great turkey too. 
206,0:16:59,0:17:03,SPEAKER 1, It's also an exponential scale so it's probably more than seven par below. 
207,0:17:03,0:17:04,SPEAKER 4, I'm a great climber. 
208,0:17:04,0:17:05,SPEAKER 3, I was a climber going I missed the last time. 
209,0:17:05,0:17:14,SPEAKER 4, You're just going great baby.  I went with Connor and Bump.  I keep like it's weird.  I'm like indoctrinating people to climbing.  And like Maya was here.  I was like you should go climbing next time. 
210,0:17:14,0:17:15,SPEAKER 1, She's like yeah I'm down. 
211,0:17:15,0:17:15,SPEAKER 3, She be sick of that. 
212,0:17:15,0:17:26,SPEAKER 4, I ask everyone I encounter if they want to go climbing.  But I have noticed that it's not as a full body of work out as I'd like.  So I started adding a hundred squats in the shower to my regimen. 
213,0:17:26,0:17:28,SPEAKER 2, Why don't you climb with like a weight belt on? 
214,0:17:28,0:17:29,SPEAKER 4, Because I can't do it. 
215,0:17:29,0:17:31,SPEAKER 1, It would be so fucking hard. 
216,0:17:31,0:17:34,SPEAKER 4, Like I'm struggling with it.  Normally it's more so like my legs aren't getting that much of a burn. 
217,0:17:34,0:17:36,SPEAKER 2, Oh so they get a little a little a little chicken. 
218,0:17:36,0:17:43,SPEAKER 1, Yeah I'm getting a tiny atrophy.  I feel like the routes that you have to be doing  to really get your legs in it.  Like really high level. 
219,0:17:43,0:17:45,SPEAKER 2, Feel the show that the folks at home what you're working with. 
220,0:17:45,0:17:46,SPEAKER 4, My milk. 
221,0:17:46,0:17:47,SPEAKER 2, You say you got no not your milk. 
222,0:17:47,0:17:48,SPEAKER 1, What does that mean? 
223,0:17:48,0:17:50,SPEAKER 4, My milky thighs. 
224,0:17:50,0:17:51,SPEAKER 2, Oh that yeah I guess so. 
225,0:17:51,0:17:52,SPEAKER 1, You see the plastic balls again. 
226,0:17:52,0:17:53,SPEAKER 4, I might flash my bottle off. 
227,0:17:53,0:17:56,SPEAKER 2, That's not that's very tight.  That is not flabby. 
228,0:17:56,0:17:57,SPEAKER 4, No it's not. 
229,0:17:57,0:17:57,SPEAKER 2, Wait. 
230,0:17:57,0:18:01,SPEAKER 1, What are you doing?  Oh my god.  Oh my god.

233,0:18:07,0:18:08,SPEAKER 3, It was fun for the whole family. 
234,0:18:08,0:18:12,SPEAKER 1, Hey if you want to talk to HR you just  kind of think about it to yourself. 
235,0:18:13,0:18:17,SPEAKER 2, Yeah.  How about you just hold that HR  bitch stupid idiot. 
236,0:18:17,0:18:19,SPEAKER 3, You send yourself a message and our plot. 
237,0:18:19,0:18:23,SPEAKER 4, The reason I'm doing likes though  is I haven't been complimented on my ass in a while. 
238,0:18:23,0:18:29,SPEAKER 2, That's not true.  I posted that video where you would drunk  and you ate the dog food as a bit  and people all they were talking about  was your fucking ass. 
239,0:18:29,0:18:30,SPEAKER 1, Do you know why? 
240,0:18:30,0:18:30,SPEAKER 2, Why? 
241,0:18:30,0:18:31,SPEAKER 4, Those are my ass pants. 
242,0:18:31,0:18:33,SPEAKER 2, You well I would argue that most pants are your ass pants. 
243,0:18:33,0:18:45,SPEAKER 4, No it used to be that way  but then the other day I was wearing pants  and then I think it was like a son  and he was like damn no ass he says.  Oh it's all I put on my ass pants  because I was going to dinner with them last night. 
244,0:18:45,0:18:50,SPEAKER 1, Hey Hassan.  You mean he's stupid.  He's loving.  He's being mean. 
245,0:18:50,0:18:53,SPEAKER 3, Notice anything rather hammy about me. 
246,0:18:53,0:18:55,SPEAKER 4, They're my ass pants.  They work so well. 
247,0:18:55,0:18:59,SPEAKER 2, I can just imagine you wearing like normal pants  and then you walk by cutie and she's like  boo. 
248,0:19:01,0:19:02,SPEAKER 1, This guy stinks. 
249,0:19:02,0:19:03,SPEAKER 3, She's watching the lighthouse. 
250,0:19:05,0:19:05,SPEAKER 2, Boring. 
251,0:19:05,0:19:13,SPEAKER 1, No ass.  You you have just said like three different anecdotes  about why you should start working out with me again.  No. 
252,0:19:13,0:19:15,SPEAKER 2, So you've kind of left me in the front or clean the fucking garage. 
253,0:19:15,0:19:17,SPEAKER 1, I was like.  Or clean the garage. 
254,0:19:17,0:19:18,SPEAKER 2, Figure out all the salaries. 
255,0:19:18,0:19:21,SPEAKER 1, If you don't clean the garage for another week  I think he's going to kill you. 
256,0:19:21,0:19:26,SPEAKER 2, It's funny.  Ludwig now.  Ludwig so there's there's a compromise going on.

270,0:20:39,0:20:45,SPEAKER 2, Yeah that's how you have to punish him  is make his decisions make have consequences  or his lack of non-action.  Hey it gets worse. 
271,0:20:45,0:20:54,SPEAKER 1, I've unlocked it.  Hold on hold on hold on I've unlocked the truth recently  because I realized I don't know if you're on a bad streak right now  but you're you're definitely subsided.  You've been awful at Discord lately.

320,0:24:12,0:24:13,SPEAKER 4, and then pussy molds. 
321,0:24:13,0:24:15,SPEAKER 1," You know, you know how they, like, "
322,0:24:15,0:24:22,SPEAKER 3," they wore like hot iron until like an ant hill.  Yeah, and they pulled out and like,  they sculpt the inside.  You can do that with like my rectum. "
323,0:24:22,0:24:37,SPEAKER 4," Okay, so I was, I was ending stream today  to go to the yard and while I'm wrapping up,  I'm like, all right guys, hey, thanks for watching.  I got to go record the yard.  Amrith in my chat says, oh, go talk business. "
324,0:24:38,0:24:39,SPEAKER 1," Okay, wait, wait. "
325,0:24:39,0:24:45,SPEAKER 4, And this is what blew my mind.  I'm scrolling through while she's saying this to find  someone to raid.  She's live. 
326,0:24:46,0:24:47,SPEAKER 2, She's the smartest. 
327,0:24:47,0:24:50,SPEAKER 4, She was in my chat and she was live.  I click on her stream. 
328,0:24:50,0:24:52,SPEAKER 1," She's going, yeah. "
329,0:24:53,0:24:55,SPEAKER 2, Was she like typing with the one? 
330,0:24:55,0:24:57,SPEAKER 4, She's gone the big clumpy headphones on. 
331,0:24:57,0:25:00,SPEAKER 3, And I hear her telling me something when she's looking. 
332,0:25:00,0:25:03,SPEAKER 4," And I go, I go, Amal, are you watching me? "
333,0:25:03,0:25:10,SPEAKER 1," She goes, that is crazy.  And dude, I thought she like does her taxes.  It's not over.  So I asked her question. "
334,0:25:10,0:25:17,SPEAKER 4," I said, Amrith, do you just like watch TV shows  in movies every time you do this?  She starts laughing. "
335,0:25:17,0:25:20,SPEAKER 1," She's like, while still licking. "
336,0:25:20,0:25:27,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, nodding her head.  Yes, while still do it.  Like she's got like this jar of water.  She's going like that noise on it. "
337,0:25:27,0:25:29,SPEAKER 1, Because she's a multitasking queen. 
338,0:25:29,0:25:35,SPEAKER 4," And I'm like, this is like,  this is like what I do when I'm at my,  like my old job as Snapchat,  I would watch a movie on the side. "
339,0:25:35,0:25:36,SPEAKER 2, Yeah. 
340,0:25:36,0:25:38,SPEAKER 4, She does this while streaming on tour. 
341,0:25:38,0:25:44,SPEAKER 3," Poor guy from Brazil in chat saying,  please butthole see now.  And she's just like halfway through lethal weapon, too. "
342,0:25:46,0:25:52,SPEAKER 1," I don't care, M-I-B-R.  I don't care phase.  I only care Amrith butthole.  Dude. "
343,0:25:52,0:25:53,SPEAKER 2," Dude, wow. "
344,0:25:53,0:25:55,SPEAKER 4, She's the hardest working streamer.  I believe that too. 
345,0:25:55,0:26:00,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, talking about that.  She wanted the kitchen with Maya.  We were like, she must have  the strongest tongue no domain. "
346,0:26:00,0:26:02,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, we were talking about her tongue muscles. "
347,0:26:02,0:26:05,SPEAKER 4," It's like super yeah, we're talking about it.  Like her tongue muscles have like biceps on them. "
348,0:26:05,0:26:07,SPEAKER 2, Like pop by when he closes her mouth. 
349,0:26:07,0:26:09,SPEAKER 4, She punches her uvula like a bunch of bad. 
350,0:26:09,0:26:15,SPEAKER 3," Bro, you ever try to like lick a toe to your whole pop  to the center, like the commercial says.  That shit hurts your mouth. "
351,0:26:15,0:26:16,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, you're not supposed to do it. "
352,0:26:16,0:26:21,SPEAKER 3," But I feel like she licks the ears more  than it takes to do that.  Yeah, in like a week. "
353,0:26:21,0:26:25,SPEAKER 2," How long, how many licks to get to the center  of a $3,000 microphone? "
354,0:26:25,0:26:26,SPEAKER 1, She also just has like sheer will. 
355,0:26:26,0:26:30,SPEAKER 4," Like I think she, there is not a number  of tosypops she would stop at. "
356,0:26:30,0:26:40,SPEAKER 2," Do you think if an audio brand, like,  I don't know, Sennheiser or something,  if they partnered with Amrith, would they get a lot of blowback  or would it be hype in the public's eye?  I think it'd personally be hype. "
357,0:26:40,0:26:41,SPEAKER 1, I think it'd be hype. 
358,0:26:41,0:26:42,SPEAKER 4, They would definitely get blowback. 
359,0:26:42,0:26:44,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, but is that good blowback? "
360,0:26:44,0:26:47,SPEAKER 4," No, because they, their market is like 50 year old boomers. "
361,0:26:47,0:26:56,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, I guess I hate it.  They should make those like, like,  binaural, like, ear, audio or microphones,  but they're both buttholes on both sides.  Dude, that would bang. "
362,0:26:56,0:26:57,SPEAKER 4, So you're just looking a butthole? 
363,0:26:57,0:26:58,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, yeah, yeah. "
364,0:26:58,0:27:01,SPEAKER 3," Okay, I feel like this would influence numbers positively. "
365,0:27:01,0:27:07,SPEAKER 1," And then to be clear here,  me as a viewer listening, watching,  and both of my ears are assholes. "
366,0:27:07,0:27:08,SPEAKER 3, You're hearing through butt sound. 
367,0:27:08,0:27:12,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Butt vision. "
368,0:27:12,0:27:14,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, you're in butt vision in the hand of it.  No, imagine fun. "
369,0:27:15,0:27:16,SPEAKER 1, Butt vision. 
370,0:27:16,0:27:40,SPEAKER 2," Hx, but it's a fucking longest part.  No, dude, okay.  So I was in a store.  It was like a Japanese like cosmetic store, actually,  because it was waiting.  We were waiting for food.  And I go in and it was very odd.  So there's like this little like section where like,  there's Japanese, I don't know,  sexual needs items, like condoms and like,  shit like that.  It was, uh, "
371,0:27:40,0:27:42,SPEAKER 4," I mean, this thing, huh?  Yes, I mean, this address. "
372,0:27:42,0:27:44,SPEAKER 2," It's sending you, you know what? "
373,0:27:44,0:27:47,SPEAKER 3," They had, they had the little Game Boy advanced connectors  so you could trade Pokemon in that section. "
374,0:27:47,0:28:07,SPEAKER 2," I will say there, uh, there's something there  that I'm gonna get for you, but I can't tell you what it is.  Anyway, so, uh, we're going, and I'm looking through.  And there was, I don't know if this is,  because I don't know about feminine hygiene  or like, if pee is squirt or if butts are like,  if we don't know what it is, they're butts.  I don't know a lot. "
375,0:28:07,0:28:07,SPEAKER 1, Right. 
376,0:28:07,0:28:20,SPEAKER 2," I'm saying there was a device for sale that,  there was a device for sale that it was like a,  I thought it was a flashlight at first.  I was like, there's a fucking flashlight  in this store next to condoms.  That's funny. "
377,0:28:20,0:28:21,SPEAKER 3, Turns out they're called flashlights. 
378,0:28:21,0:28:23,SPEAKER 1, They make light anywhere. 
379,0:28:24,0:28:27,SPEAKER 4," A guy who knows about a flashlight before, before the flashlight. "
380,0:28:27,0:28:30,SPEAKER 2," He's like, oh, yeah, I just fucked this thing,  but it also makes light. "
381,0:28:30,0:28:34,SPEAKER 3," It's like kids, you guys need that.  It's like kids know about among us before space. "
382,0:28:34,0:28:41,SPEAKER 1," It's so fun.  You know, when you open the end of a flashlight  to like pour the batteries out,  and then you could just fill that with like, uh, "
383,0:28:41,0:28:51,SPEAKER 2," whatever you want.  Yeah, with molten metal.  And so, so I, and it's like, what it actually was,  because I like looked at the box,  it's like a vacuum pump for pussy. "
384,0:28:51,0:28:53,SPEAKER 3," Oh, like a, wait, wait, wait for pussy. "
385,0:28:53,0:28:54,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, it was like a high, "
386,0:28:54,0:28:56,SPEAKER 3," I was gonna say like Austin, awesome powers, but. "
387,0:28:56,0:28:59,SPEAKER 2," Oh, maybe it was a suck machine.  I don't know. "
388,0:28:59,0:29:00,SPEAKER 3, It was just pumping. 
389,0:29:00,0:29:08,SPEAKER 2," It was either was his penis, but it was, basically, it was a device,  but it looked like it couldn't house a penis.  It was more for like a, it was like a short fat thing. "
390,0:29:08,0:29:08,SPEAKER 4, Not yours. 
391,0:29:08,0:29:12,SPEAKER 2," And it was like, stop, stop. "
392,0:29:13,0:29:14,SPEAKER 1, So you stopped that. 
393,0:29:14,0:29:15,SPEAKER 2, That's beautiful penis. 
394,0:29:15,0:29:19,SPEAKER 4, You'd be clear that was me having a small dick joke.  You didn't pick it up. 
395,0:29:19,0:29:20,SPEAKER 3," Oh, there was small, and then yours wouldn't. "
396,0:29:20,0:29:22,SPEAKER 2," Other you to, yeah, I meant, you know what? "
397,0:29:23,0:29:24,SPEAKER 4, Now he likes it. 
398,0:29:24,0:29:26,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, that's it.  Soft legs. "
399,0:29:26,0:29:27,SPEAKER 3, Soft legs. 
400,0:29:27,0:29:28,SPEAKER 2, That's so soft. 
401,0:29:28,0:29:29,SPEAKER 1," You're, anyway, you're touching him. "
402,0:29:29,0:29:32,SPEAKER 2," I don't know if it was like a, is, is a vacuum pussy. "
403,0:29:32,0:29:33,SPEAKER 1," It's funny, buddy. "
404,0:29:33,0:29:35,SPEAKER 3," Do you want us to go back and, you want us to buy it? "
405,0:29:35,0:29:37,SPEAKER 1," So anyway, I got it.  We could buy it. "
406,0:29:37,0:29:38,SPEAKER 2," I don't care, but my question is. "
407,0:29:38,0:29:39,SPEAKER 3, We can learn together. 
408,0:29:39,0:29:46,SPEAKER 2," Do people do, I'm sorry.  Do women use a vacuum to suck things out of their pussy?  Okay, I don't know. "
409,0:29:46,0:29:49,SPEAKER 3," No, this is a, this is the thing in Luigi's Mansion. "
410,0:29:49,0:29:54,SPEAKER 2," That's true.  Yeah, would zippers show this?  Hold your eyes three times.  Is that a thing you guys know about this? "
411,0:29:54,0:29:58,SPEAKER 4," I don't think this is something that's commonly used.  So I don't think it's, it's like, "
412,0:29:58,0:30:05,SPEAKER 2," well, did you know there's things that more people soak than use this?  You're stupid as shit.  You don't have a pussy. "
413,0:30:05,0:30:11,SPEAKER 1," I think as far as I understand,  the ginors are self-cleaning, which is why, like,  it's not actually good to do. "
414,0:30:11,0:30:13,SPEAKER 2, They're like dishwashers. 
415,0:30:13,0:30:15,SPEAKER 1, So I imagine it's time to put some soap in. 
416,0:30:16,0:30:17,SPEAKER 3, You put it on the mouth. 
417,0:30:17,0:30:19,SPEAKER 1, You open the whole piece of the packet. 
418,0:30:19,0:30:23,SPEAKER 3, You just do it to answer.  This is terrible.  We're gonna lose fucking it. 
419,0:30:23,0:30:24,SPEAKER 2," No, no, no, no. "
420,0:30:24,0:30:25,SPEAKER 1," Okay, I'm against conversation. "
421,0:30:25,0:30:26,SPEAKER 4, I think so. 
422,0:30:26,0:30:28,SPEAKER 1, The person is already so low. 
423,0:30:28,0:30:36,SPEAKER 2, Like a peak behind the veil.  I just didn't know if people needed to suck things out of their  orifices with the machine.  I didn't know that was the thing. 
424,0:30:36,0:30:37,SPEAKER 1, That's all women. 
425,0:30:38,0:30:40,SPEAKER 4, So you can let us know in the comments. 
426,0:30:40,0:30:40,SPEAKER 1, I need you. 
427,0:30:40,0:30:41,SPEAKER 2, Downed off. 
428,0:30:41,0:30:42,SPEAKER 4, So you can get the hymen up. 
429,0:30:42,0:30:42,SPEAKER 3," On ironically, yes. "
430,0:30:42,0:30:44,SPEAKER 1," We didn't do here.  Yeah, it's time. "
431,0:30:45,0:30:48,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, that was pretty much it.  I just wanted to bring that up. "
432,0:30:48,0:30:48,SPEAKER 1, I'm a scaly. 
433,0:30:50,0:30:52,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, everyone was saying that we brushed over this last time. "
434,0:30:52,0:31:01,SPEAKER 2," We didn't brush over it.  We just, here's the thing, guys.  The best thing about appreciating a nice quip  is you let it go.  Like, the worst thing you can do is like,  wait, what did you say? "
435,0:31:01,0:31:05,SPEAKER 1," Oh, scaly!  Boy, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo. "
436,0:31:05,0:31:08,SPEAKER 2," This is like a, sometimes it's way cooler, just to let things pop. "
437,0:31:08,0:31:09,SPEAKER 1," You know, we were talking about, uh, "
438,0:31:09,0:31:10,SPEAKER 2," I mean, I did my job. "
439,0:31:10,0:31:12,SPEAKER 1, Antidona's fun house that one time. 
440,0:31:12,0:31:13,SPEAKER 2," Oh, yeah, yeah. "
441,0:31:13,0:31:16,SPEAKER 1," And it was that one bit where, uh,  the one dude's name is Janiel. "
442,0:31:16,0:31:19,SPEAKER 2, Janiel.  Which is funny the first time.  Calerius. 
443,0:31:19,0:31:27,SPEAKER 1," But then they talk about how his name is Janiel  for like two more minutes.  And it's like, man, if you just left it at him being Janiel,  that is a god tier bit. "
444,0:31:27,0:31:28,SPEAKER 2, That's fire. 
445,0:31:28,0:31:33,SPEAKER 3," They're actually fire at like starting bits really funny  and then being like, oh, wow, okay.  We've decided that this will not be funny. "
446,0:31:33,0:31:35,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, Antidona and Twitch streamers. "
447,0:31:35,0:31:37,SPEAKER 3," They have, I don't know if it was before they had, "
448,0:31:37,0:31:38,SPEAKER 2, I can't let go. 
449,0:31:38,0:31:45,SPEAKER 3," I don't know if this is before they had an Netflix show or not,  but they have like a YouTube episode  that, uh, it's them playing four square. "
450,0:31:45,0:31:45,SPEAKER 2, Really? 
451,0:31:45,0:31:49,SPEAKER 3," And it's, it was really funny when it started.  And I was like, this is everything I want. "
452,0:31:49,0:31:49,SPEAKER 1, Please don't. 
453,0:31:49,0:31:50,SPEAKER 2, Antidona guys. 
454,0:31:50,0:31:53,SPEAKER 3," I'm like, please deliver this.  Because like, because like, handball is huge, not sure. "
455,0:31:53,0:31:54,SPEAKER 1," They're on Australian, I guess it checks out. "
456,0:31:54,0:32:06,SPEAKER 3," And, but they call it four square in the video.  I think it's because like, maybe they have like a larger  American audience or something.  And, uh, it was a train wreck.  They got so much less funny as they went off.  Yeah, we could kill this. "
457,0:32:06,0:32:07,SPEAKER 1," You just, where they get it with it though? "
458,0:32:07,0:32:09,SPEAKER 4," They like, they're good. "
459,0:32:09,0:32:10,SPEAKER 1, Were they trying well? 
460,0:32:10,0:32:11,SPEAKER 3," No.  No, they're playing terrible. "
461,0:32:11,0:32:12,SPEAKER 2, Would you dice them? 
462,0:32:12,0:32:15,SPEAKER 3," I would dice the show.  I mean, dude, we're getting, we're getting nice. "
463,0:32:15,0:32:20,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, this is it.  Oh, this is it, yeah.  That's so interesting.  Okay, I guess I forgot. "
464,0:32:20,0:32:34,SPEAKER 3," And like, like the beginning, he's like,  he's like talking to someone on the sideline  that he serves it when he's not looking.  He's like, that was a dog move.  And like, all the things they're saying,  it's like very real.  It's like when we play with our shield and friends,  like, it's all very real.  Uh, and then it just turns into this like weird cartoon  that like doesn't exist. "
465,0:32:34,0:32:43,SPEAKER 2," Wow.  Well, speaking of Twitch streamers,  Ludwig, I want to bring this up.  Yeah.  Our good friend, Michael Bonthers,  yeah, got you in some hot water. "
466,0:32:43,0:32:44,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, I got some beef. "
467,0:32:44,0:32:45,SPEAKER 3," Oh, I don't know anything about this. "
468,0:32:45,0:32:49,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, please recount it for the viewers at home,  including Nick, who is a viewer at home. "
469,0:32:49,0:32:50,SPEAKER 1, All right. 
470,0:32:50,0:32:54,SPEAKER 2," It is leather jacket that's made of leather,  leather, a lion. "
471,0:32:54,0:33:29,SPEAKER 4," Michael Bonther came over and he was here for main stage  and he went one day came back.  We were talking the whole next day,  because we went rock climbing together.  And he was like, yeah, it was a weird thing happened.  While I was at main stage,  there's these people who had set up like a speed dating booth.  And they're going around.  They're trying to find people to speed date.  And like, one person came up to me.  And they're like, you want to go speed dating?  And Michael's like, no, I got a girlfriend.  And they're like, oh, well, this is like,  this is on Destiny.  This is like with Destiny, like in his girlfriend, Malena.  Like, you could hook up with like Malena,  like Destiny's girl.  And cause they're in a real relationship.  And then Bonther's like, no, I'm like really good. "
472,0:33:29,0:33:30,SPEAKER 3, And that was so weird to say. 
473,0:33:30,0:33:41,SPEAKER 4," That was the story.  And I had recounted this on stream.  And I was like, it's weird.  There was a couple of, because the way it had been phrased me,  I thought it was Destiny's event that had been happening. "
474,0:33:41,0:34:03,SPEAKER 2," To be fair, we had heard about this before hand as well  in terms of like this speed dating thing was like,  I don't know, kind of being talked about being a thing.  But you know what I'm saying?  And Destiny's name came up a lot.  So like, there was this idea that like,  doesn't have nothing to do with it, bro.  And it's like, well, if that's the case,  then someone was just saying his name. "
475,0:34:03,0:34:04,SPEAKER 1, Destiny was in the email. 
476,0:34:04,0:34:22,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, so the streamer, I think it's Cuba.  It had it's like who's like a, she's a girl who streams  and his friends with Destiny and Malena.  Had I think like asked them to do it.  And they're like, yeah, we'll do it.  And Destiny didn't end up showing up.  But the people who were helping like the goons  that were roaming around, we're kind of like "
477,0:34:22,0:34:24,SPEAKER 1, trying to throw that cloud around. 
478,0:34:24,0:34:32,SPEAKER 4," Just kind of like trying to throw the names out  and be like, hey, like maybe this will get you to do it.  Cause like, otherwise it's kind of embarrassing  to go live on Twitch and do speed dating. "
479,0:34:32,0:34:44,SPEAKER 2," If you're just like average.  I in general, I thought the idea was kind of like,  it wasn't had, it had best intentions.  Cause it's obviously like, hey, let's see  what these socially inept gamers are gonna do.  Yeah, that's what I was thinking.  Like, fucking, let's clown around. "
480,0:34:44,0:34:49,SPEAKER 4," I watched you for like five seconds.  It was hugs.  And then the only thing I saw was her and she went,  you can go now. "
481,0:34:50,0:34:53,SPEAKER 1," And then he was like, okay, and I was like,  damn, this is awkward. "
482,0:34:53,0:35:04,SPEAKER 3," I have some extra lore for this.  Okay.  So the reason that this all happened is because,  so the streamer you mentioned, I couldn't remember,  I can't remember the name.  Yeah.  The streamer you mentioned, her editor is a smasher. "
483,0:35:04,0:35:05,SPEAKER 2, Okay. 
484,0:35:05,0:35:06,SPEAKER 1, His name was Will. 
485,0:35:06,0:35:14,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then I told, I told his goddamn friend,  I remember his name.  I don't know.  I brought bronze. "
486,0:35:14,0:35:15,SPEAKER 1," Fuck, Brody. "
487,0:35:15,0:35:16,SPEAKER 2, Brody. 
488,0:35:16,0:35:17,SPEAKER 1, Brody. 
489,0:35:17,0:35:17,SPEAKER 2, Brody. 
490,0:35:17,0:35:19,SPEAKER 1," Brody was a, Brody was a different guy. "
491,0:35:19,0:35:21,SPEAKER 3," No, but his friend was the guy. "
492,0:35:21,0:35:22,SPEAKER 1," Oh, he was?  Yeah. "
493,0:35:22,0:35:24,SPEAKER 2," Oh, I'm thinking of dude.  Anyway, I'm not your Brody. "
494,0:35:24,0:35:28,SPEAKER 3," Anyway, they watch, they both them watch the yard.  So if you're watching, shout out. "
495,0:35:28,0:35:29,SPEAKER 1, That's out. 
496,0:35:29,0:35:33,SPEAKER 2," So you fuck, he fucked my boy, he, he edits for her "
497,0:35:33,0:35:38,SPEAKER 3, and he comes to me asking if they can do this.  I already know about the email that we kind of just like  ignored it. 
498,0:35:38,0:35:39,SPEAKER 4, We being beyond the summit. 
499,0:35:39,0:35:45,SPEAKER 3," We being beyond the summit.  And I was just like, okay, I don't know.  I'll talk to her. "
500,0:35:45,0:35:46,SPEAKER 2, It's also not your call. 
501,0:35:46,0:36:08,SPEAKER 3," Not my call, but it is content at the event.  So it's like something that I can inquire about.  And like, you know, I can inevitably make a decision  about kind of.  And so she ends up showing up anyways.  And I talked to her about it.  And I was, and she really wanted to do it.  And I was like, all right, well, you can do it  under these conditions.  Like you don't do it in the venue.  You don't mention the event.  You do it outside the event. "
502,0:36:08,0:36:09,SPEAKER 2, Okay. 
503,0:36:09,0:36:22,SPEAKER 3," Whatever.  And like those are the conditions that it was fine.  And they were totally cool about it.  It was whatever.  But some like background all this is like,  Melina is someone that I know outside of all of all of this. "
504,0:36:22,0:36:24,SPEAKER 2," We got some old, yeah, it's crazy. "
505,0:36:24,0:36:52,SPEAKER 3," Because so like she walks in the venue.  I don't know anything about her coming.  And she just walked, she's like, be lines to me.  And I was like, holy shit, what the fuck are you doing here?  And we like, we talked for like a really long time.  And the reason I know her is because a long time ago  she was dating a smasher in Sweden.  And then they came to America.  This is like six years ago.  They came to America and stayed at my house  because they were going to a pink Floyd concert.  And I met both of them before she was  at all involved with streaming.  She didn't even know Destiny. "
506,0:36:52,0:36:59,SPEAKER 4," If you're an average Twitch viewer,  you will have known the guy that stayed with us  because he was live with Destiny and Melina. "
507,0:36:59,0:37:00,SPEAKER 2, That's right. 
508,0:37:00,0:37:07,SPEAKER 4," There was like a lot of like conspiracies  like Destiny's hooking up with her behind his back  and like, you'd be on stream by himself  and they'd be disappearing. "
509,0:37:07,0:37:39,SPEAKER 2," When on my show, when I was on the, the fucking, the Roshler.  Yeah, I was on the Alex Patesa episode.  Destiny was on it.  And I in the show live, I said, bro, do you know  Acid Fuckboy, which is the guy's tag.  Which is the guy's tag because I met him  because they stayed at Nick's house  and I went there all the time and he's really nice.  And I was like, yeah, I know that guy.  And I told him why and everyone is like kind of confused  why I'm doing this.  And then Destiny's like, oh yeah, I know Max. "
510,0:37:39,0:37:41,SPEAKER 1," I was like, cool. "
511,0:37:41,0:37:42,SPEAKER 2, That was that. 
512,0:37:42,0:37:52,SPEAKER 1," So there's this weird like, what a so crazy.  This was the thing we found out when I moved in  with you guys and this came up in conversation,  we realized that I had met and become friends "
513,0:37:52,0:37:56,SPEAKER 2, with Max on a separate occasion because you're an EU slut. 
514,0:37:56,0:38:02,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, and I'd hoe it out at Smash tournaments over there.  And me and Max became friends.  Like he's just like super. "
515,0:38:02,0:38:05,SPEAKER 3," He's just so chill, really easy to talk to. "
516,0:38:05,0:38:25,SPEAKER 1," And I was like, how the fuck do you know this guy?  Oh yeah, he stayed at our house two years ago.  I was like, I met him two years ago.  Just in a different part of the world.  And now I'm standing there with Nick  trying to explain this to Blina.  But she's a nameless cat.  Which he's got an off throw.  Trying to explain for them beginning. "
517,0:38:25,0:38:34,SPEAKER 3," She also didn't know that we live with you.  Like she has your own context.  So she was like, also, that was like another part of it  that she was just like, wait, what?  Like very confused by. "
518,0:38:34,0:38:40,SPEAKER 1," All these absurd layers of like crossover.  And then I, you know, I guess they finally "
519,0:38:40,0:38:52,SPEAKER 4, they finally got into the end of the Kingdom Hearts plotline  is that I said this on stream  and then Destiny reacted to it.  And it was not his event.  He was supposed to be there.  I think he didn't end up going on show partly  because of probably me saying that on a stream. 
520,0:38:52,0:38:53,SPEAKER 1," You know, and I'm sure. "
521,0:38:53,0:39:00,SPEAKER 4," I imagine that might have influenced it a bit at least.  And then there was, you know, a bunch of threads  on live stream fill. "
522,0:39:00,0:39:02,SPEAKER 2," And I was like, all day was the back and forth. "
523,0:39:02,0:39:05,SPEAKER 4, There was back and forth.  And that's what it was. 
524,0:39:06,0:39:07,SPEAKER 3, I don't understand what. 
525,0:39:07,0:39:10,SPEAKER 2," So he had said, yeah, so he told Mike's story on stream. "
526,0:39:10,0:39:13,SPEAKER 1," Oh, I told Mike's story.  I said like these two goons said like that, like "
527,0:39:13,0:39:27,SPEAKER 4," you could fuck Malena, which is weird.  And I said like, you know, and then I said  at the end, I think for content, I guess.  And then Destiny watching is like, well, it's not my thing.  I'm not doing this.  This is Cuba.  And so, you know, at the end, it wasn't, it wasn't him. "
528,0:39:27,0:39:29,SPEAKER 2, It was just I think it does suck. 
529,0:39:29,0:39:33,SPEAKER 3, You invite you to a discord call.  Like it instantly starts debating you. 
530,0:39:34,0:39:43,SPEAKER 2," Honestly, that's why I tweeted that out.  Cause like I can't debate, debate kids that,  and then debate adults, like, I, what was this tweet about?  They freaked me out, dude, that's all. "
531,0:39:43,0:39:44,SPEAKER 3, How so? 
532,0:39:44,0:40:18,SPEAKER 2," Because dude, they just like, they have so much logic.  I see.  And they just, all their whole job is to just trap you  in like, little logic puddles and no matter what you do,  the debate kid in my mind never agrees.  I think I like got PTSD for my friend growing up  who would never be okay losing an argument ever.  Even if he's like clearly wrong,  be like, well, that just doesn't make sense.  And he'd be like, a fucking prick about it.  And I'll be like, sometimes it's okay to be wrong.  But like, and so debate kids now,  and people who debate like, as a thing, they freaked me out.  Cause I'm like, I can't talk to him like I'm a human. "
533,0:40:18,0:40:21,SPEAKER 4," He was stressed.  He's like, bro, you can't get rid of those people. "
534,0:40:21,0:40:26,SPEAKER 2," I think it's right.  I told everybody, I was like, don't fuck,  don't fuck with Destiny, bro.  I can't handle debate kids, bro.  They fucking. "
535,0:40:26,0:40:31,SPEAKER 4," Destiny's like, I don't get why a lot of it hates me.  It's like, probably cause Cudi hates me,  probably cause I hate Casey.  Like it is the whole thing. "
536,0:40:31,0:40:33,SPEAKER 2," Tell the people, I've met Destiny. "
537,0:40:33,0:40:42,SPEAKER 4," I've met Destiny and we hung out briefly at TwitchCon.  He just doesn't remember, I think,  cause I was a 200 year old baby.  Yeah, I was a baby. "
538,0:40:42,0:40:43,SPEAKER 1," Little guy, what I met him? "
539,0:40:43,0:40:44,SPEAKER 2," Well, what, how'd you feel about that? "
540,0:40:44,0:40:45,SPEAKER 4," It was fine, it was fine. "
541,0:40:45,0:40:47,SPEAKER 1, People were arguing about this on live streampales? 
542,0:40:47,0:40:55,SPEAKER 2," Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Cause it was Destiny reacting,  and then Ludwig reacting to that react.  And like, this happens a lot.  This is the Oroboros of like LSF drama. "
543,0:40:55,0:41:02,SPEAKER 4, It's kind of sick in a way cause you can just manufacture  more drama by just talking about it  and then showing like your stream or the clip  or the reaction. 
544,0:41:02,0:41:03,SPEAKER 1, Do you think they watch the reaction? 
545,0:41:03,0:41:05,SPEAKER 3," Do you think he's reacting right now to this?  Do they, can we all look at him? "
546,0:41:05,0:41:07,SPEAKER 1, Keep it up. 
547,0:41:07,0:41:08,SPEAKER 2, I don't imagine. 
548,0:41:08,0:41:34,SPEAKER 1," Do you?  Now that I have the full scope of what happened,  like beginning to end from the introductory email  to standing there talking with them,  telling them what they could and could not do  to this anecdote to you guys creating clips about it after.  And then to imagine that all of that happened,  which is really dumb and really simple,  and then some of you fucks at home  sit on Reddit and talk about it.  As saying, yeah, this is not new. "
549,0:41:34,0:41:37,SPEAKER 2, You also replied to a Reddit.  It's different.  That's different. 
550,0:41:37,0:41:38,SPEAKER 3, It's different. 
551,0:41:38,0:41:43,SPEAKER 1," It's different.  It's different because Cody.  It's just because.  You know, I'll do it. "
552,0:41:43,0:41:44,SPEAKER 2, I'll do it. 
553,0:41:44,0:41:51,SPEAKER 1," Just Cody and the blue guy.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.  It's the blue guy.  Okay, we're going to a little bit each other.  I'm happy with the blue guy.  I'm happy with the blue guy, "
554,0:41:51,0:41:52,SPEAKER 2, a little bit more. 
555,0:41:52,0:41:55,SPEAKER 3," Let us do a few more cartoon noises,  and then you can go.  Beep beep beep beep beep. "
556,0:41:55,0:42:14,SPEAKER 1," Beep beep beep beep beep.  All right go ahead Cody and I have known each other for a long time. We did in-person discussion about the problems with the schedule.  And he interviewed with somebody, complained about it, lied in the interview. "
557,0:42:14,0:42:16,SPEAKER 3, How do you lie? Tell us. 
558,0:42:16,0:42:33,SPEAKER 1," He just, okay, in the article he says like the tournament I played until this time on this night and this time until until this night are on that night and I didn't get any sleep.  And just both of those things are verifiably untrue.  Yeah, not like like a small margin like 10 minutes before that. "
559,0:42:33,0:42:41,SPEAKER 2," It was like several hours before you said we have developed a way to measure time which is like like you know, like passing the passage of it. "
560,0:42:41,0:42:42,SPEAKER 1," Oh, is that that clock shift? "
561,0:42:42,0:42:51,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, it's that clock shift.  So it has to do with minutes and hours.  And so he got that wrong.  Like the time that he said that something occurred. "
562,0:42:51,0:43:11,SPEAKER 1," By a large ratio him.  No, I don't want it to happen.  I don't want it to happen.  But the reason the reason that I say ratio is two people who are there for the in-person interaction of what happened.  I am simply correcting what actually happened.  In this case, it's people online making conjectures about the thing they don't know about. "
563,0:43:11,0:43:19,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, you did reply and read it.  But I think the how do you sit here on Reddit all day is such a tired. "
564,0:43:19,0:43:32,SPEAKER 1," No, no, no, it's not about spending time on Reddit to begin with.  It's about the idea that you would comment on something you are so far removed from.  Whereas I commented on something because I was there involved in the thing doing the thing. "
565,0:43:32,0:43:36,SPEAKER 4, I discovered epic wrap battles of history again. 
566,0:43:36,0:43:39,SPEAKER 3," Wait, what sort of transition is?  What about epic wrap battles? "
567,0:43:39,0:43:40,SPEAKER 4, I'm going to get their story. 
568,0:43:40,0:43:44,SPEAKER 3, That's what I'm saying.  I stole that.  Don't high five me.  I stole it. 
569,0:43:44,0:43:45,SPEAKER 1, It's a tweet. 
570,0:43:45,0:43:52,SPEAKER 4," Yeah.  Well, I watched it.  And one of the videos 10 years old.  It showed me commenting on it 10 years ago. "
571,0:43:52,0:43:53,SPEAKER 1," Oh, shit. "
572,0:43:53,0:43:54,SPEAKER 2, Did you see it in the wild? 
573,0:43:54,0:43:56,SPEAKER 4," I told 280,000 shows. "
574,0:43:56,0:43:57,SPEAKER 1," It said, it said check out my mom. "
575,0:43:57,0:43:59,SPEAKER 4, It's my same love account. 
576,0:43:59,0:44:02,SPEAKER 3," It said check out my slug.  No, it's because you're laughing. "
577,0:44:02,0:44:04,SPEAKER 1, My friend Ben thought it was stupid. 
578,0:44:04,0:44:07,SPEAKER 4," But it's the same YouTube I had 10 years ago, which I guess is a little more rare. "
579,0:44:07,0:44:08,SPEAKER 1, That's actually great. 
580,0:44:08,0:44:22,SPEAKER 4," It shows a 10 year old YouTube comment.  It's in a sea of 280,000.  And at the end of every epic wrap battle goes, who's next?  You decide.  And I wrote, can we get Rebecca Black versus who's a guy who does never  going to give you up? "
581,0:44:22,0:44:23,SPEAKER 1, Rick Asley. 
582,0:44:23,0:44:24,SPEAKER 4, Wow. 
583,0:44:24,0:44:29,SPEAKER 1, And that was my suggestion for an epic wrap battle with a bowl cut.  And you know what?  That would go. 
584,0:44:29,0:44:30,SPEAKER 4, And I was one of these. 
585,0:44:30,0:44:31,SPEAKER 1, And I'm one of those people. 
586,0:44:31,0:44:33,SPEAKER 4," Hey, I add to the pools of comments. "
587,0:44:33,0:44:35,SPEAKER 2," Hey, hey, you could make it happen now. "
588,0:44:36,0:44:38,SPEAKER 4, I just thought I'd like to say I'm my DBZ. 
589,0:44:38,0:44:41,SPEAKER 2," I think I've heard that you know my original brain is really, really fast. "
590,0:44:41,0:44:46,SPEAKER 1," I'm telling the dog, and I laugh and I was literally utter dead.  I'm not happy with that. "
591,0:44:46,0:44:47,SPEAKER 3, You are doing crap on this whole thing. 
592,0:44:47,0:44:48,SPEAKER 4, How else am I doing this? 
593,0:44:48,0:44:58,SPEAKER 2, I can't! 
594,0:44:58,0:45:04,SPEAKER 1, I've made sauce for you.  I didn't make it happen.  I've record it.  You've been doing it for a whole lot. 
595,0:45:04,0:45:06,SPEAKER 3, Watch y'all jump.  You gotta watch it. 
596,0:45:06,0:45:10,SPEAKER 2," You feel like friends.  My saber is like blue, which signifies he's like new to be in a jet. "
597,0:45:10,0:45:15,SPEAKER 4," I rewatch it.  It was Trump versus Hillary, I want to say. "
598,0:45:15,0:45:16,SPEAKER 1, And Trump. 
599,0:45:16,0:45:17,SPEAKER 3, Imagine this was melee. 
600,0:45:17,0:45:20,SPEAKER 4," Basically says the N word, hard R in the video. "
601,0:45:20,0:45:21,SPEAKER 2," What do you mean, basically? "
602,0:45:21,0:45:24,SPEAKER 1," Well, he implies it.  You either say it or you don't. "
603,0:45:24,0:45:25,SPEAKER 2, Does he like rhyme a word? 
604,0:45:25,0:45:28,SPEAKER 4, He rhymes a word with the N word and then doesn't say the word. 
605,0:45:28,0:45:29,SPEAKER 3, I see. 
606,0:45:29,0:45:32,SPEAKER 4, Which is as close to saying the N word as you can possibly be. 
607,0:45:32,0:45:37,SPEAKER 1," Sure.  And I was I was like, that's crazy.  Damn. "
608,0:45:37,0:45:38,SPEAKER 4, They say. 
609,0:45:38,0:45:39,SPEAKER 2," Ooh, demonetized. "
610,0:45:39,0:45:42,SPEAKER 4," But no, but not back then.  They still got 54 million views. "
611,0:45:42,0:45:44,SPEAKER 3," Oh, they paid out their grandfathered in. "
612,0:45:44,0:45:49,SPEAKER 1," No, I think it was just it was a lot of the long time ago.  It might have been limited out before they, yeah, before they. "
613,0:45:49,0:45:50,SPEAKER 4, Crazy. 
614,0:45:50,0:46:22,SPEAKER 2," Anyway, I was I was doing some editor payouts for you.  And I I paid someone out who got like a percentage of revenue.  It's for coal.  It's like a percentage of revenue for 30 days after the video comes out, right?  And then I checked it and then I calculated it.  And then I checked the revenue since, which was like a month after that 30 day period.  And the video had earned like $10.  Yeah, it's crazy.  Like, like, I don't know if you guys know this, but if for you drop a video,  and the first like three days, it makes 90% of its money. "
615,0:46:22,0:46:23,SPEAKER 1, And then it gets 90% of its views. 
616,0:46:23,0:46:28,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, and the rest of the time, it just exists and makes $10 over $2, really collects.  It's really interesting. "
617,0:46:28,0:46:34,SPEAKER 4," Depends on like the video, like some are, you know,  the slow bleed or just be like huge videos and get million every year. "
618,0:46:34,0:46:37,SPEAKER 2, But I just most I realize the machine keeps you. 
619,0:46:37,0:46:41,SPEAKER 1," They were they were getting the old, the old ad rate on that channel. "
620,0:46:41,0:46:42,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, I think about it. "
621,0:46:42,0:47:04,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, they're making big books because we were talking about this,  this past week was the David Dobrik thing where he's getting interviewed by like men's health.  And he talks about the amount of money he used to make on his YouTube channel.  And pre pre ad apocalypse when he was way smaller, he made 250K a month.  And that was when he was, I don't know, he had like a million, a couple million subs. "
622,0:47:04,0:47:11,SPEAKER 4," Well, I don't think that was pre ad apocalypse.  So this was all still post ad apocalypse because I believe the ad apocalypse is  PewDiePie saying the N word. "
623,0:47:11,0:47:11,SPEAKER 2, That's right. 
624,0:47:11,0:47:12,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, this is before. "
625,0:47:12,0:47:15,SPEAKER 2," Well, no, it wasn't the N word.  It was the Hitler thing, right? "
626,0:47:15,0:47:16,SPEAKER 4," No, it was the N word. "
627,0:47:16,0:47:19,SPEAKER 1," This is like, no, it's the Hitler thing. "
628,0:47:19,0:47:20,SPEAKER 3, There's like BC and AD. 
629,0:47:20,0:47:24,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, yeah, it really is.  It is.  I think every YouTuber buys the catalyst. "
630,0:47:24,0:47:27,SPEAKER 3, Literally every by saying the N word was the crucifixion of the 
631,0:47:27,0:47:28,SPEAKER 1, Jesus. 
632,0:47:28,0:47:37,SPEAKER 2," No, literally every YouTuber should get together and just link  Queenie PewDiePie.  Because he fucked with literally everyone's back from there on out. "
633,0:47:37,0:47:39,SPEAKER 4," I mean, I'm looking at the back. "
634,0:47:39,0:47:42,SPEAKER 3, We go back and link with the fuck out of PewDiePie.  That is so fucking. 
635,0:47:42,0:47:44,SPEAKER 1, I look at the bag and I feel browser. 
636,0:47:44,0:47:45,SPEAKER 3, Opera G. 
637,0:47:45,0:47:47,SPEAKER 1, Fuck you.  What a fucker. 
638,0:47:47,0:47:56,SPEAKER 4," Fucking browser.  I think what it did is like a reset time.  But I feel like it's, I don't know if it's equal where it was.  But I can't imagine it being higher.  It'd be crazy.  YouTubers already make so much. "
639,0:47:56,0:47:58,SPEAKER 2, Yeah.  I don't know. 
640,0:47:58,0:48:08,SPEAKER 1," I don't know.  Ten million views on a video.  You get like 100K.  No, but I think that was the whole thing with the David Oberg interview.  He was saying like now, even with that amount of views, he made no, basically no money "
641,0:48:08,0:48:12,SPEAKER 4," on it.  Well, he made no money because he had copyrighted music in most of his songs. "
642,0:48:12,0:48:14,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, but also content stuff. "
643,0:48:14,0:48:22,SPEAKER 4," He usually, he usually, this is the secret insider info.  He said that.  But the reality is that he just puts copyrighted music in most of his videos, like almost "
644,0:48:22,0:48:23,SPEAKER 1, all of them. 
645,0:48:23,0:48:31,SPEAKER 4," Yeah.  So, he doesn't, like he'll probably have some demonetized 100%.  Yeah, he demonetized.  Also means getting less views. "
646,0:48:31,0:48:36,SPEAKER 1," But if he's getting more, like, yeah, if you get like no views, and he would not be as "
647,0:48:36,0:48:37,SPEAKER 4, big as he is. 
648,0:48:37,0:48:38,SPEAKER 1," So, he manipulated it. "
649,0:48:38,0:48:42,SPEAKER 4," Yeah.  He's a little bit of a capper.  Oh, David Dobrik manipulating.  Name a better duo. "
650,0:48:42,0:48:49,SPEAKER 3," Oh, call leader, call leader, uh, about David Dobrik in the thumbnail of the video. "
651,0:48:49,0:48:50,SPEAKER 4, Okay. 
652,0:48:50,0:48:51,SPEAKER 1," Oh, this is his video. "
653,0:48:51,0:48:54,SPEAKER 4, We talked about David.  And then it's a flush light. 
654,0:48:54,0:49:00,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, no, it's a vacuum pump to get the David David Dobrik Bussey. Do you think we can get him? "
655,0:49:03,0:49:07,SPEAKER 1, Looks like I did you got it. Do you think you have enough cloud to DM him? 
656,0:49:07,0:49:16,SPEAKER 4, What is I'm sorry? I got distracted  We have this new thing now where we have a white board. I brought a white class and I just read through for the first time 
657,0:49:16,0:49:18,SPEAKER 1, I'm gonna bring a class and this says Saikuno diaper play 
658,0:49:19,0:49:37,SPEAKER 4," But we'll get into that right after a sponsor of this week coin base back at it again coin base a loyal sponsor of the pod  Coinbase.com forward slash the yard you get $10 in Bitcoin if you sign up right now  You have to go to Coinbase.com for especially yard. It's you know, it's a place to trade crypto "
659,0:49:37,0:49:44,SPEAKER 2," It's it's you get your crypto coin. Yeah, get the app and get the use the code which we took it  It took a long time to get that code "
660,0:49:44,0:49:48,SPEAKER 3, Don't be like me don't know the code exists and then make a coin base account and forget to use it 
661,0:49:48,0:49:53,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, that's what I did he did RL and he does not have 10 Bitcoin  $10 "
662,0:49:53,0:50:03,SPEAKER 1," No, you know, that was the deal got a stop saying 10 Bitcoin. Who knows you gotta sign up to find out it's a coin flip really  Yeah, the coin base is a loaded "
663,0:50:04,0:50:10,SPEAKER 2," Thanks for thanks for sponsoring the pod coin base. Shouts out. Shouts out. So yeah, you want to you want to talk about Saikuno diaper play "
664,0:50:10,0:50:17,SPEAKER 3," Oh my god, I can't believe this is on the whiteboard. So here we go. Do I want to talk about this? Yeah, yeah, so here's I was thinking about "
665,0:50:17,0:50:24,SPEAKER 4, This real quick by saying the way you talk about the people that I have to hang out with and enjoy hanging out with online 
666,0:50:25,0:50:32,SPEAKER 1," Only hurts and fractures those relationships. No, and here I am if you were a loved one has been diagnosed with Saikuno diaper play "
667,0:50:32,0:51:44,SPEAKER 2," You may be entitled to compensate me. Let me do my best to not fracture those relationships by explaining my perspective  I was thinking about it and  You play video games a lot with like the brand say family-friendly influencer crew, right?  And to those people that come to mind immediately are people like  Valkyrie and Saikuno specifically  They are meant to be your G rated almost like everything's good and therefore the biggest bag is available to get now  Something I've always felt was kind of weird was that their audience feels like it's primarily  Teenagers maybe even like pre-adolescent like kids that watch them a lot  and I was thinking if  Saikuno is okay with that being his audience to me that's weird  Why I was in the kitchen defending Saikuno and because here's the thing because if the yard if you've heard of it  It's a little bit of a p-cast. Uh-huh  If the yard was only like 15 year olds literally, I know it's impossible  But like literally only 15 year olds listen to this show. I would not do it, right?  That would make me uncomfortable because that's not my audience  I don't want to be someone that just like makes kid content look "
668,0:51:44,0:51:49,SPEAKER 1," I don't not fucking I don't want to jump in his corner, you know, and normally "
669,0:51:49,0:51:51,SPEAKER 4, Let me just say mr. Rogers 
670,0:51:52,0:52:11,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, but not very different. Wait, is that the case? Hey, so he's mr. Rogers. Let's go. So that's a little  Different right? That's literally a kid show, sir. Okay, so you're you're confirming that that's what they also can be enjoyed by adults  But it's not what do you mean like mr. Bob Ross people don't know. That's way different. Oh, that's a skill "
671,0:52:12,0:52:17,SPEAKER 1," Also, wait hold on. Thank you. We're trying to talk about that party. He's right about that part "
672,0:52:17,0:52:23,SPEAKER 3," I think mr. Rogers is a good example. Oh, mr. Rogers is great, but mr. Rogers, Bob Ross  Bill. Hi. Bob Ross is not a bill neither bag example "
673,0:52:24,0:52:37,SPEAKER 2, My question is are you saying that these two particular in this type of creator is meant to be targeting these audiences  And is fully aware of that because mr. Rogers is very clearly a kid show for kids 
674,0:52:37,0:52:47,SPEAKER 3, I teach him not sharing it. I think that they like streaming  They like playing games with their friends. They like that they make a shit on a money doing it  And they compartmentalize that their audience is so young and don't really think about it 
675,0:52:48,0:53:09,SPEAKER 4," I also think it's so tired to blame a creator for the age of the audience  It's like the day one rose people did it for me for so long. I don't do it. Yeah, people call you like the Disney guy on  Yeah, which is really funny. All the fucking guy and they just roast you. It's like they're watching like if you have a large amount of viewers  The first rose people jumped to his and they are all kids kids watch you excuse you receives it miskip receives it  You know "
676,0:53:09,0:53:10,SPEAKER 1, eight and Ross 
677,0:53:10,0:53:19,SPEAKER 4," Remember like there was a clip of an eight and Ross viewer who's young and he's like a 13 year old and he's like oh, yeah  I watch eight and Ross super cool kid. He's like actually like really chill on the stream and "
678,0:53:20,0:53:23,SPEAKER 1," cool kid  Yeah, how cool was he bro? He was so tight "
679,0:53:24,0:53:28,SPEAKER 3, He was Billy who's going to the ball is how was I'm looking at cigarette was that was backwards? 
680,0:53:29,0:53:31,SPEAKER 1, Did it smoke a doobie rip one drag? 
681,0:53:31,0:53:35,SPEAKER 4, Took a sip of his ass. I feel like that's just the day one rose that everybody applies 
682,0:53:35,0:53:39,SPEAKER 1, I think I think that they are the main demo to be clear 
683,0:53:39,0:53:47,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, but and they also they offer up this sense of content  It's specifically so I could know where it's like he's very like small bean and it's like "
684,0:53:48,0:53:52,SPEAKER 4, I don't think you watch I could know maybe I don't and no like I'm saying you don't I don't 
685,0:53:54,0:54:07,SPEAKER 2," Am I am I completely wrong? Yes, so he's not small bean  He says every time I've seen a vibe or something. He's small very small bean and I'm like  You're 30 and it's weird. It's weird to me. Tell me why I'm wrong "
686,0:54:08,0:54:12,SPEAKER 1, It's weird to laugh and do this when you're 30. That's all I'm saying. I think he's just insecure and you guys 
687,0:54:13,0:54:25,SPEAKER 4, You guys won't you two  I'm just you specifically are the most weird pair of social view of all my people the cop on the pod say you know  I think X is depressed. I think B is absolutely 
688,0:54:25,0:54:41,SPEAKER 1," Adip shit hold on hold on. I'm not in the line right in the corner on all of your stuff. You are on his corner for this  Yeah, I'm Nick right now. I'm Nick right now where I agreed with like one thing. He's an end  I didn't say anything extra. He said it for me. Yeah, what the fuck you you often times "
689,0:54:41,0:54:51,SPEAKER 4, I feel like go too deep in your conspiracy theories that's right. That's right. Exactly. That's why I  And it makes it weird 
690,0:54:52,0:54:58,SPEAKER 1, Tell me I'm wrong Justin Timberlake. Tell me I'm wrong and why he did because that's all I've done this no 
691,0:54:58,0:55:02,SPEAKER 2," Yes, I literally did not about the diaper play. I did "
692,0:55:03,0:55:07,SPEAKER 1, We haven't explained the diaper play yet 
693,0:55:10,0:55:16,SPEAKER 2, It's basically like the online version of diaper play  What to me? 
694,0:55:17,0:55:19,SPEAKER 1, This doesn't make it anymore clear 
695,0:55:22,0:55:24,SPEAKER 4, I don't know 
696,0:55:25,0:55:48,SPEAKER 2," It's when you like it's like it's like when you dress up like a nurse with your significant other to like cosplay  But it's all based on like being a baby and wearing a diaper and keeping it right and it's like this infant  It's like a sexual kid. Yeah, it's like no any Martinez  It's like that does nothing for me. She's like a lot of her iconography was like being a weird like sexual baby  Okay, and that's what I yeah "
697,0:55:49,0:55:51,SPEAKER 1, Yeah 
698,0:55:52,0:55:56,SPEAKER 2," And and yeah, and I always thought that was weird and I get the same vibes from "
699,0:55:56,0:56:05,SPEAKER 1, From the idea that you think that's the same. I think it's the same because of you think jerking off to diapers and babies is equivalent  swearing on a street. Let me clarify 
700,0:56:06,0:56:11,SPEAKER 2, I'm trying to clarify and I'm not being allowed to clarify in this great debate court. You know what? 
701,0:56:11,0:56:15,SPEAKER 3, Here's your space. I love your time. I would love for you to say it 
702,0:56:15,0:56:41,SPEAKER 2, And it feels like the amount of  I guess like fandom around psycho know in a very like  infantile but like romanticized way from adolescence  Is weird and maybe it's like well how are you supposed to stop that? It's like say you don't like it  Say that I don't like that don't do that  But I feel like people are afraid to do that because it fucks with the bagorino 
703,0:56:42,0:57:14,SPEAKER 4," I think that you  In everything you stand for and everything you make  Just immediately shuts off a huge part of of not just age group of people, but also women  Pretty much everything you create is usually directed towards men  Okay, male humor sure, and I think his is much more appealing to women and it's not just an age thing  I think this is like  Like there are like teen girls, but also like 20-year-old girls college girls who likes icono more  And I think they might just prefer like you know someone who doesn't talk about dick balls "
704,0:57:14,0:57:35,SPEAKER 2," I know that's why I think that makes a lot of sense  And I think to be fair. They're probably a lot more quiet about it, right?  Say dick say dick ball like these 20 these 20-something year olds that are enjoy let's say  Sikuno they're they're not as loud on Twitter because they're like adults now  And they don't need to feel that sense of like identity with the thing they like right? "
705,0:57:36,0:57:41,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, so that makes sense. They're pretty loud. They I think they're allowed to I think they're allowed as well "
706,0:57:41,0:57:51,SPEAKER 1, They live tweet every stream he does. I want the stats. I'm trying to put peace together. I want the demo stats  I don't think that's a good point owes me that I think you put just should watch his stream 
707,0:57:51,0:57:55,SPEAKER 4, You are making a deal about a man who's stream you've never watched. That's right. Which is the cycle on that's right 
708,0:57:57,0:58:04,SPEAKER 1, And I don't know how when he weighed that broad sweeping generalization about how I date people and how I feel nothing 
709,0:58:04,0:58:09,SPEAKER 4, And I'm like you didn't meet anybody I dated the closest I've come to killing myself talking to you 
710,0:58:12,0:58:17,SPEAKER 2," Wait, no, but I think you're right. I'm literally trying to I'm trying to have a discussion that was harsh "
711,0:58:19,0:58:23,SPEAKER 1," That's how I feel  But all right, so I could a diaper play "
712,0:58:23,0:58:28,SPEAKER 4, Well the checklist. I think that I think that I'll ask him will revisit it next week. I'll ask him how he feels about nurses 
713,0:58:28,0:58:47,SPEAKER 2," I think that you're right and  Like the idea that like the content I make is is generally geared toward literally like me, right? Yes, like it's only me and I think  Women being included is something that I haven't I haven't really ever like had to think about right?  It's like why well you know why should I would just kind of selfish "
714,0:58:47,0:58:56,SPEAKER 4," I think you exclude everything that you don't like which is what a 32 year old man likes  Sure, and so it's like if you are not that if you are younger or if you are woman or if you're even older "
715,0:58:57,0:59:11,SPEAKER 2," It's all excluded. Yeah, and I think about that a lot too where I'm like oh man  Am I am I gonna just constantly age and only be seeking like this secret like in insanely  Targeted demographic that I care about and um, I think about that a lot "
716,0:59:11,0:59:23,SPEAKER 3," I think I would agree with everything you said if he was going live to fucking take off his shirt and flex  No, yeah, yeah, I think because he's just playing games and like you know kind of awkward  I think he'd be doing that if his audience was adults "
717,0:59:24,0:59:37,SPEAKER 2," Does it also it begs the question? Does it?  Does getting older require someone to like act differently?  I think that's what a lot of creators gonna run into right? I get that a lot  Bro, you're 30. Why are you molding on the internet with people? It's like "
718,0:59:38,0:59:42,SPEAKER 1, As I love it. That's the Kim star roast. You know what I mean? So what sounds 30 and he malls? 
719,0:59:42,0:59:48,SPEAKER 2, Everyone's gonna get older you're gonna be older one day  You're gonna be 30 and that's like the this bar. I mean where you're like oh you're gonna die 
720,0:59:48,0:59:54,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, you're maybe 27 club. Whoo. Why are you shaking my hand like you did it? I got three years left "
721,0:59:54,0:59:55,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, there you go "
722,0:59:55,1:00:05,SPEAKER 2, That's this bar where you end up like oh 30 now. You're not allowed to be  Something right and everyone's gonna start running into that because a lot of these guys aren't kind of close 
723,1:00:05,1:00:17,SPEAKER 4," There's always been new people that find new like there are people say 30 and then people like 35 and then 40  Yeah, you when they're older you get but old people are also not funny  So I guess at some point there's a switch you think so yeah, what happened to Dane cook man will about me "
724,1:00:19,1:00:22,SPEAKER 3," So funny  Yeah, you're at the you're at the Dane cook of the art "
725,1:00:23,1:00:25,SPEAKER 2, But in his prime 
726,1:00:25,1:00:27,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, yeah "
727,1:00:28,1:00:30,SPEAKER 3, And a man in his Amazon prime 
728,1:00:32,1:00:41,SPEAKER 1, That didn't that didn't make I just do we put out the hand. I hate that he puts out the hand to learn to do literally show a little discipline 
729,1:00:44,1:00:49,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, I like that also he denied me a handshake earlier. Did he just catch an L's "
730,1:00:49,1:00:56,SPEAKER 3," Well, no, I denied receiving one. That's right. That's different. I didn't think I deserved it speaking speaking of scalies "
731,1:00:57,1:01:09,SPEAKER 1," Whoa, oh, where what do you guys know what scalies are? I have no idea as people like  I assumed it was like jerking off the list. I assumed it was like reptiles or something. It's it's it's people who are furries, but for "
732,1:01:10,1:01:11,SPEAKER 4, Dragons 
733,1:01:11,1:01:17,SPEAKER 1," Oh, yeah, quickly or all lizards. Oh, dragons has to be drag dude. I'm a scaly. Well, because say you know like furries "
734,1:01:17,1:01:26,SPEAKER 4," I mean there's different subsets, but like oh like a furries generally a wolf  You know, you're not like a furry. I don't think that's true. It's gentle. Yeah, I think it's like the main right "
735,1:01:26,1:01:28,SPEAKER 1, That's my dog 
736,1:01:28,1:01:33,SPEAKER 2, That's the main that's the main I think if you are into tigers you are equally a furry and there's a lot of tiger-likeers 
737,1:01:33,1:01:37,SPEAKER 4," There's tiger-likeers, but I'm saying this the main demo for a furry is a wolf or a dog "
738,1:01:37,1:01:42,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, of course you are equally a furry, but you could definitely break down the stats  Of what the most common animal is "
739,1:01:42,1:01:46,SPEAKER 4," I probably in that room. It's a melting pot, but the majority of people are Christian "
740,1:01:46,1:01:54,SPEAKER 2, I was gonna say  White or Christian. Yeah  If you're furry sound off the comments and genuinely what is the breakdown? 
741,1:01:55,1:01:59,SPEAKER 3, Because I would love to know of like animal. We also have no ideas. It's good to be good to know 
742,1:01:59,1:02:02,SPEAKER 2, Because we it's furries and smash players are very interesting 
743,1:02:02,1:02:09,SPEAKER 4, We did that test. We did a test at the G4 event because soda poppins obsessed with furries and VR porn and jerking off 
744,1:02:09,1:02:12,SPEAKER 3," We hold on hold on are those three related? Yeah, how can you they? "
745,1:02:13,1:02:18,SPEAKER 2," Sexual being yeah, but you see like into furries or is it in love with the idea of them as a joke? "
746,1:02:18,1:02:32,SPEAKER 4, I think like all things it started ironic and then like he actually like for example  Ironically he was interested in like VR in like VR porn like you know and whatever right and then he actually just jerked off with a bunch of his friends 
747,1:02:32,1:02:34,SPEAKER 3, And then he was like then he was like damn those three 
748,1:02:35,1:02:42,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, he actually did this. Yeah, it goes to like strip clubs in VR often then he beats his knee. Yeah, does he have way does he have open mic "
749,1:02:42,1:02:51,SPEAKER 2," Can you hear your friends like grunting? Oh, yeah, I think so dude that's nuts dude. Yeah strip club in VR with proximity chat "
750,1:02:52,1:03:00,SPEAKER 1, Hmm  Guys in the corner you don't go that's actually the American dream. I don't know. I don't think that's why the soldier's spot 
751,1:03:03,1:03:10,SPEAKER 3," We're like walks up. He's like  Um, that's nice, but I don't think I'm gonna play the game tomorrow, so I probably won't see you again "
752,1:03:13,1:03:20,SPEAKER 2," Dude, I could imagine a world war two soldier just ready to like cave in some German guys head with the rifles like this one's for digital titties "
753,1:03:22,1:03:34,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, my moral day hits and fucking soda pop and hops on VR  But yeah, he does that I think he ironically was interested in furries  And then I think he's like more unironically now "
754,1:03:34,1:03:38,SPEAKER 3, Interested in furries do this scaling. I'm gonna let me do this. This sounds high 
755,1:03:39,1:04:31,SPEAKER 1, So the reason the reason I brought this up was because after our conversation last week  I was reminded of the  Of just the insanity that was Genesis 3 in 2016  This is at the San Jose Convention Center  Genesis 3 the most infamous or famous infamous probably the incorrect word  Tournament that there is and it'd been years since Genesis 2 which was like this fabled tournament  So everybody was going to Genesis 3 and the same weekend in the San Jose Convention Center was a  Furry convention. Yep. Apparently the largest furry convention in the United States  And then also in the ballroom between these two events a high school girls club of volleyball tournament. Yeah  And it was a packed building it created probably probably the most 
756,1:04:31,1:04:34,SPEAKER 4, Do you have so many same combination for that combo? 
757,1:04:34,1:04:39,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, there was a CIA agent in a fucking tower two miles away with a sniper rifle "

I played in pm or sorry p plus this weekend at me  The furry of melee it's the furry of melee and it's a mod of brawl made to play a lot faster and differently  And it had a huge following, but now it got like put in the corner by Nintendo  So it's kind of like this weird underground scene still sick game. I really like to play you see Chris return after three years  Cheated and he what did he do he told a bunch of people is going to start streaming  Scammed them out of giving him money for a computer to stream and then disappeared chill and raise the money for it "
769,1:06:19,1:06:24,SPEAKER 1, That was high chill and stream was like let's get let's get peekers a piece. He curses streaming PC. That was classic

He pluses the new name and I'm playing and I haven't played a long time  But I play Ganon and I enter and these are people who have played this game a lot  They know all that there's like a shitload of matchups play against a Lucario player literally wearing a right you outfit with a tail  Like what is a right you up like a right you like onesie. So it's like slimming 
771,1:06:55,1:06:59,SPEAKER 1," He's not like thick right, but it's just like an orange back. It's not like a mascot costume "
772,1:06:59,1:08:13,SPEAKER 2," It's like as if you it's like something you would like order on the right you know, but it's very clearly right true  Not Pikachu. Yes, because it was a lot of brown. Yeah, I see and there was the tail  And I was like okay, and then I get diced up by Lucario and then I'm like  There we go, and it's on stream actually because I was the first round  And yeah, and then the next round I play I play someone named Juan Diferous, which is actually friends with Mike  And Mike's my plays a lot of PM and this guy he plays Luigi  And he was winning and he starts like fucking spot doesn't like nine times in a row  He's like he's playing very disrespectful. I'm getting mad. I'm like, this is bad. This takes out. I don't deserve this  I'm just trying to play a normal game, and I'm being treated like I'm a joke, you know  He splottages three times it was it wasn't really nine in a row  And he was only up one stock. I'm like why dude like this is so much pecubus anyway. I I tell Mike about it  I'm like, do you know this guy? He's like, yeah, I'm like  FOS for for life. I hate him paid on site like we are not we're we're not cool ever  And then Mike's like I hate to tell you this, but he's really funny and instantly all my anger melted away "
773,1:08:13,1:08:58,SPEAKER 3," Juan Diferous. Yeah, Tyler song. I've learned I've learned this about so I'm not recently just in general that  Humor is everything. I was actually talking about this recently with a fan a fan at mainstage was like  Should I go up to him and like try to make him laugh because I want him to like do this thing  And I said do not do that. I said actually just leave. Yeah, which I  Because that's actually what he wants even though you don't get what you want out of that exchange  That's what he wants  I was like so like people have like this sort of spectrum of like what they sort of desire people  They keep closer like want to talk to everyone. You know, it's like oh 10% of it is like they're passionate about stuff  I'm like 20% is just slimes is 95% you are funny slimes hierarchy of needs. It's it's not you are funny "
774,1:08:58,1:09:03,SPEAKER 2," It's just every funny. It's do not do cry. Yeah, no, it's it's pussy Nyquil being funny "

No, no, no, okay. It's literally like food shelter self-actualization  But yeah, humor is at the bottom. It's the base "
777,1:09:30,1:09:40,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, I look sturdy base. I learned I learned this because like there'd be people who like he would like really dislike  For reasons that I felt were small and then they'd like say something funny online. They'd be like I like that guy "
778,1:09:40,1:09:45,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, this happens with president. Yeah, this exact thing happened. Yeah, he was like I hate president "
779,1:09:45,1:09:49,SPEAKER 2, I hate that I thought he was I thought he was being genuinely mean to you and I didn't like that 
780,1:09:49,1:09:57,SPEAKER 3," But then I found it which is admirable. He was just funny. You know what I'm about for your friend. Yeah  Yeah, it's so funny. He just changed everything. You get a furry. That's why I "

783,1:10:14,1:10:25,SPEAKER 2," It's funny because Sonic Fox will pick up a game that a scene for instance like world combat has been playing for years and years  Yeah, and then come in clean up and then like just go to a different while wearing of his persona "
784,1:10:25,1:10:34,SPEAKER 4," That's right. Yeah, it'll just dust you in his persona  And you can put your life into something and then he'll pick it up beat you  With his persona on yeah, I think "
785,1:10:34,1:10:45,SPEAKER 2," Sonic Fox's twitter bio for long time was like a black queer furry who will mix your shit in fighting game  Yeah, and I'm like I think he will yeah, and he literally will as advertised. Yeah, yeah, I played "
786,1:10:45,1:11:04,SPEAKER 3," I played one game with Sonic Fox before. Oh, yeah, and it was Mario party four. Oh, I bet you went that one  Hey, he got his shit mix  And I will never forget it. I want to who's black and queer now  That would be the most insane  Maybe of all time "

808,1:13:08,1:13:10,SPEAKER 1," All the portals yeah, okay "
809,1:13:12,1:13:22,SPEAKER 2," It's a portal gun that's a pocket pussy, and it shoots  Pussies into the wall the voice amaran  And it's no words. It's just the sucks sounds. It's just tongue "
810,1:13:24,1:13:28,SPEAKER 4," Just every movie or place limitless, but you get the fuck a pocket pussy to be a genius "
811,1:13:30,1:13:37,SPEAKER 3, You yeah in the comments put insert a pocket pussy into a movie somehow  This is like a tweet hungry box would put out funniest one show it gets shown the next 
812,1:13:37,1:14:30,SPEAKER 2," What movie would you add pocket pussy to to make it hilarious? He posted on the r-slash pocket pussy Twitter  Do you guys if you don't know  What it's no I'm down. It's fun. It happened. It's a hungry box once. He's a top melee player. That's her story  He wants he wants uh he wants tweeted on the the subreddit r-slash black people Twitter  Yeah, he posted an image, which was um was it his own tweet? It was his own tweet  It was hungry boxes own tweet which had something to do with like dragon ball Z  And he posted it on r-slash black people Twitter, which I believe he's like fellas  Which was a subreddit I'm at the cookout  And uh and everyone was like it got found really quickly that H box did it  And they were like what the fuck are you doing? "
813,1:14:31,1:14:40,SPEAKER 1," The weird part was like he didn't he didn't do it on like an all-to-count or like a run away  He's not black. It's yeah, it's not a big component "
814,1:14:40,1:14:49,SPEAKER 4, It's his eyes is when you let go the gas pump and it hit exactly $30 on the first try  And then it's Goku reacting saying so this is the power of ultra instinct 
815,1:14:49,1:14:54,SPEAKER 1, This is so funny because why he kept his own tweet header in dude insane 
816,1:14:54,1:14:59,SPEAKER 2, In apps I to this day I look at this and I'm like what was going through your head that growth probably 
817,1:15:01,1:15:07,SPEAKER 3, It's like a funny tweets Twitter like can you post it there?  I don't know like it wasn't related to the community maybe 
818,1:15:08,1:15:29,SPEAKER 4," But it's just like you know how I did the video like youtube is is um skill not luck  Part of it was me donating $50 to miskip to post the video about him  People apparently miskip told me have donated $2,000 to him. Oh, yeah  Any bag catchers they donated $2,000 to him with just like the most random videos "
819,1:15:29,1:15:33,SPEAKER 2, Why him it's so funny you see in the log of it. You're like I must do miskip 
820,1:15:33,1:15:35,SPEAKER 1, That's the streamer that I needed to do it to me 
821,1:15:35,1:15:54,SPEAKER 4," And it's like the videos would be like this is a 10 minute dissertation on why the Baroque period was the greatest  And I was like I appreciate this video, but this is not what I want not to watch on stream. That's passion  It is passion, but it's like there's a very specific community  I was targeting by donating to miskip and they're like oh, you just donate to miss "
822,1:15:55,1:15:57,SPEAKER 1, And then the video pops off it is funny 
823,1:15:57,1:16:52,SPEAKER 2," We mean even we're talking today about like it's still in the smasher mindset slash grind set to like  I just got to put an hours bro  I'll just play melee for nine hours straight on stream and that's how I you know grow my stream and it's like yeah  That's not that was my question. It's actually what I wrote down is like  For instance, let's say all right. Let's say hugs because it's a way. I feel about hugs is stream  hugs has demonstrated to me that I don't want to watch his stream right like he is he makes stuff  And then I was like it's always gonna be the same thing and I've decided I don't like it, right  And I say this because he's like he's smashed and smashed adjacent  So he kind of was the first to for me to experience this  And so I'm like I'm never gonna like be interested in that stream  And I'm wondering can people blow it like people who've been like streaming for four years for 20 viewers  Like are they done because then so many people's minds that they've already encountered the first impression was "
824,1:16:52,1:16:59,SPEAKER 3," No, I don't want to watch this person. I think everyone is like  You could just get blown up by some random thing. Yeah, if a video hugs "
825,1:16:59,1:17:07,SPEAKER 4," Like okay, let's just say a mr. Beast video got posted on hugs his channel. You immediately blow up  You know what I mean, okay, so it's like it doesn't matter. It doesn't know "
826,1:17:07,1:17:30,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, even if people are aware of you, I think I think it's because I think it's because if you blow that first impression  You're only accessing like a small portion of some community  So maybe you ruined it with them  But there's always another pool of people that you put have the potential to like set a new first impression  You may well stream the first time ever to those people also sometimes like someone like might have watched a yard "
827,1:17:30,1:17:41,SPEAKER 4," And been like this isn't for me. It's too much of a boys club to yada yada  Seeing a clip at a friend recommended and then they're like, oh, I actually fuck with the yard  And I'm sure a bunch of people in the comments are like, oh, yeah, that's me what's up man  And so it's like, you know, you'll just give things second chance of sometimes "
828,1:17:41,1:18:02,SPEAKER 1," I actually am curious because there there's some comments. I'm like, you know, we're on episode like what this is this is 20 right?  Congratulations 20th episode  Anyway, I love that joke  Like the last we were like I'm watching the podcast for the first time. This is great  I'm wondering like how you how you decide to watch it like 19 episodes in you know "
829,1:18:03,1:18:09,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, well, I think it's because it's not titled in a way where it's like oh you got to watch the first 20  It's number 20 now. It's in the thumbnail "
830,1:18:09,1:18:20,SPEAKER 1," But it's like a pretty small part of it. I'm more just saying like what changed between like  Oh, I see you mean yeah, oh  Yeah, right. I don't know about it. Yeah, or good title. Good combo. Yeah, potentially. I guess that's the "
831,1:18:20,1:18:34,SPEAKER 3, What it comes down to there's been a ton of projects that like I like  I think for a good a good example of this is a cold ones where it's like something that I knew about for a long time  I was watching Max Mofo like Pokemon videos like years and years. I know who he was 
832,1:18:35,1:18:38,SPEAKER 4," Dude, Max is such a dog. Well, sorry. I'll go to that later "
833,1:18:38,1:19:10,SPEAKER 3," And like I knew anything for views because he's like he was like in tons of shit online  And but I'd never ever watch their show and then they just one of the thumbnails hit for me  And I was like, oh, what's this and I clicked on it and now I like their show. Okay  So they just had to like  Nothing was getting me even though I knew who they were and knew I already liked them  I just like I wasn't a type of person who clicks and watches a show on YouTube  And then now that I know I like their thing when I see a new one  I'm like, oh, yeah, sure. I'll watch it  Yeah, so I think people just like don't know about us and then they find out about us "
834,1:19:10,1:19:37,SPEAKER 2," You know what gets me big what what what loops me in is  What could you big? Yeah, yeah, I didn't think I didn't think about how big is it that it's so big for you  Give me as big as you can right now. You know what hooks me in. Yeah, and gives me big. Yeah  Is friend recommendations like if someone says stop the cap. This is really good. No, stop the guy  Randomly sent things through I sent somebody videos of you and watch my fellow. That's not true. I watch all your shit "
835,1:19:37,1:19:43,SPEAKER 4," I said one time. Yeah, I said one one. No, I said one one time that you didn't watch and now I will never send you a video again "
836,1:19:43,1:19:48,SPEAKER 1, It's okay. That was what happened. That's all right. You will send me stuff and you have never 
837,1:19:48,1:20:07,SPEAKER 2," Friend recommendations are also here. Yeah, it's you know, it's fun. Well not even also not even just friends if someone I like  Trust their opinion one time lucky tweeted about final fantasy  15 and I was I had never played it and he's like this is a great fun fantasy game  I love it and I played those games all the time and I played it because of that tweet and I liked it was good "
838,1:20:08,1:20:10,SPEAKER 4, I watched squid game because of shroud 
839,1:20:11,1:20:18,SPEAKER 1," Same thing. Yeah, that will go a long way otherwise you probably wouldn't I wouldn't have heard of it. Yeah, he's gone around and why are you talking about squads? "
840,1:20:19,1:20:34,SPEAKER 4, Speaking of okay holidays are coming  Two big things from the holidays and I brought this up because the max mofo is the YouTube ad sense because  Max mofo if you guys don't know YouTube ad it's it gets way more dollar per view in 
841,1:20:35,1:20:40,SPEAKER 1," In December and I remember max. Oh, it went up. Oh, it goes way out in December. You get about double "
842,1:20:40,1:20:53,SPEAKER 4," Whoa the or triple yeah, whoa it goes nuts depends so max uploaded like  Eight videos in December. I would watch every one of the Pokemon boxing. I was really in a Pokemon. January first hits  Ghost town yep for like three months "

895,1:26:56,1:26:58,SPEAKER 3, I continued to give good impressions 
896,1:27:00,1:27:09,SPEAKER 4, Maya is not that familiar with the other people in the house  And we went to get bagels me  I was right. Nick just did a really good fortnight dance 
897,1:27:10,1:27:13,SPEAKER 2, I wish you did it for like a bro. Bro. I was that was unfortunate

899,1:27:32,1:27:34,SPEAKER 2, Yeah 
900,1:27:34,1:27:36,SPEAKER 3, I make a reference me and Maya making a fucking 
901,1:27:37,1:27:42,SPEAKER 1, We get our back-backs on or fucking now for the yard patreon Maya teaches you how to dogy

904,1:27:57,1:28:01,SPEAKER 4, We come back  We're eating the bagels now again. Maya does not know them that well 
905,1:28:02,1:28:10,SPEAKER 1," Sign comes down. He's like, oh dude. I really got bagels. You got bagel man. This was good  And he and he's like yeah, I got a big one and so I got a real close to him. I got like this "
906,1:28:10,1:28:15,SPEAKER 4, He gets up in his face right next to him. Uh-huh in a threatening way 
907,1:28:15,1:28:19,SPEAKER 1, And  Kind of like powers watch over and do a ball 
908,1:28:20,1:28:28,SPEAKER 4, He travels into a ball goes over to get a fork to eat his meal  Slime while he does this just eats the egg at that's a part of his meal 
909,1:28:28,1:28:43,SPEAKER 2," No, no, he he's even getting a fork to eat like an egg that fell his bagel  I scoot I slide in front of his meal and I sit there like it's mine now and then you and I'm like this looks good  And then he gets a fork out of the drawer and I I put out my hand for him to hand it to me "
910,1:28:43,1:28:52,SPEAKER 1," Maya's watching it. Maya's watching this horrified like she's not horrified. She left  She like she left like a nervous laughter like oh, it's my meal neck. No, she left like that was a good bit "
911,1:28:52,1:28:54,SPEAKER 4, It's the guard coming through 
912,1:28:55,1:29:01,SPEAKER 2," Oh shit, that's great taxes on my bagel today. Me and me and Aiman we we that was a tag team bit "
913,1:29:01,1:29:06,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, you and Maya are best friends though  No "
914,1:29:06,1:29:10,SPEAKER 2, If I'm hurt and I see that I'm like that guys cool 
915,1:29:10,1:29:24,SPEAKER 4," We got to address this now by the way before this gets away from us  We did hit 10k in the patreon, which does mean you need to get a tattoo Nick  So we need to discuss how we are going to get you equipped with a tattoo  How do people get to choose what you get a tattoo? Do you have any idea? "
916,1:29:25,1:30:04,SPEAKER 3," So well, I announced this to the discord already, but to the general population to the general pubis the way that we're doing this  The general the general pubis  Uh, we are we have a discord server and uh, so if you're gonna if you're in the patreon  Uh, we have a discord and in the discord we have a channel  That is for suggestions for my tattoo  This channel has a shit ton of suggestions in it now. They are fucking awful  Uh, there is there is nothing to be redeemed in that you really disappointed  Uh, but  One of them's going on my body permanently forever. That's right  So the way we're gonna do it is we are gonna create a bracket that Aiden will seed "
917,1:30:04,1:30:14,SPEAKER 1, Hmm that that is single eliminations. Why does the man with zero tattoos see this?  He's the most experienced. He's a T.O. He would know how to seed them the best. I would know how to seed 
918,1:30:14,1:30:18,SPEAKER 2," Which is literally just ordering things from best to worst. Yeah, is what seeding is. So "
919,1:30:19,1:30:28,SPEAKER 3," We're gonna make a single elimination bracket  It'll be voting base so you vote and then it goes to the next round  And then when it gets to the very last two for grand finals, it's marbys "
920,1:30:28,1:30:44,SPEAKER 1," Oh, I did that for my tattoo. That's cool. I'm taking from the father like son the bag the bag of Ludwig tricks  Is a swag jacker of me. He took my path. I took my path. That's right. I didn't take your puff. I learned from your  Disney clothes. He took my raw climbing "
921,1:30:44,1:30:46,SPEAKER 3, Don't say that one 
922,1:30:47,1:30:50,SPEAKER 1, Make him take that back. He took my Disney clothes. Oh my god 
923,1:30:52,1:30:58,SPEAKER 2, You guys look like you just struck the most important deal of oil in the history of oil 
924,1:30:58,1:31:01,SPEAKER 4, I want one of the tattoos to be you took Ludwig's Disney 
925,1:31:01,1:31:22,SPEAKER 3," Clothes. Yeah, you took the Mickey Mouse hood the reason why jacked Ludwig the reason why I wanted marbys to the end for for the  You know for the public. It's like oh, it's hype for me. I'm like marbys is by the way random  I'm like it's my out if there's one that like is a clear winner in this race  It creates a coin flip that at least I have a chance right okay, let's say there's a clear winner that is like horrible "
926,1:31:23,1:31:30,SPEAKER 2, It gives me a coin. So let me let me recap. It's double. It's it's the final two will be marbys head to head 
927,1:31:30,1:31:35,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, literally just too marble. No, it would be like 50 of each. So this is so that you can't tell immediately who's gonna win right? "
928,1:31:35,1:31:38,SPEAKER 1, I was just thinking that okay. This is a voting process 
929,1:31:39,1:31:43,SPEAKER 3," For the bracket. Yeah, how does the bracket work? Yeah. I yes, I found a way to I found a way to do this "
930,1:31:43,1:31:48,SPEAKER 4, But like can I just like be like yo boys and on stream and just rig the bracket. Yes 
931,1:31:50,1:32:05,SPEAKER 1," That's the one would wait, but can you just vote? Nick is dumb pussy. Hey voting will be patreon only because it's their choice  so  I would say based on the the content that's been posted so far there there is a very high chance my face ends up "
932,1:32:05,1:32:08,SPEAKER 3, Why don't you go why don't you go through? Oh actually I love zippers 
933,1:32:08,1:32:10,SPEAKER 4, Can I ask a question? How do we add things to the bracket? 
934,1:32:11,1:32:16,SPEAKER 1, Is that a is that a thing that's determined by you? There's a there's a chat. There's a channel 
935,1:32:16,1:32:39,SPEAKER 3," So basically I created like a guideline of like things that I will not accept  And then I am essentially going through and picking things that like  I am willing to put on my body and I'm being very loose with it like I am a things  I think are like the like fucking terrible, but I'm like whatever it's not name something you like that you don't have off limits  Like a swatzika. Gosh  You're gonna say it no matter what I said "
936,1:32:40,1:32:43,SPEAKER 4, And I'm sad you said swatzika because now I look like a nazi 
937,1:32:44,1:32:54,SPEAKER 3, But a better example is like if someone someone was like some people were putting like jokes from episodes that like just happened  And I'm like that won't be funny in like a week pull my putt for life 
938,1:32:55,1:33:00,SPEAKER 2, I'd rather be pulling my putt pull in my putt it would like my dad's older than all of us like like like a lot of people wrote like 
939,1:33:01,1:33:03,SPEAKER 1, Because 
940,1:33:03,1:33:05,SPEAKER 2, And I'm so funny and I'm like oh 
941,1:33:06,1:33:18,SPEAKER 3, It's just so I'm like it's just so passing and I'm like it doesn't make sense like that kind of stuff gets left out  But if it's like like there's ones of like it's like aim in deep-fried smoking weed. I'm like yeah  I don't want that but like it's in there 
942,1:33:18,1:33:24,SPEAKER 4, So I'm assuming these are just by the way ideas you know the drawing and then the drawing will be made from the idea 
943,1:33:24,1:33:34,SPEAKER 3, I made it a rule in the server that if you if you're gonna submit an idea you have to submit a picture  It doesn't mean that the picture has to be the final version  I just need a reference can't just describe because if we are gonna make it better 
944,1:33:34,1:33:39,SPEAKER 1," We'll have the artist draw it, but I need a reference can I add some things to this bracket you will rig it if you do that "
945,1:33:39,1:33:50,SPEAKER 3," You have to add like one if you add something you will rig it. I will add it as an ult  Yeah, an ult comes in and just adds a random idea or you could you could slide somebody a fiver "
946,1:33:50,1:34:01,SPEAKER 2," And then there's a way to do this, but I don't think someone would leak because  Knicks like a fan favorite and you're the heel and I'm the heel and name is the heel and next the heel "
947,1:34:03,1:34:05,SPEAKER 3, We're a dude with four heels 
948,1:34:06,1:34:08,SPEAKER 2, It's gonna work 
949,1:34:08,1:34:10,SPEAKER 4," Either way, I'm pretty hyped for it "
950,1:34:10,1:34:20,SPEAKER 3," Is it is an aspect of it lie my dream would be if we could just have the artist come up here and do the episode while I'm getting tattoo  Oh, we could do that. Yeah, we should do that. I know if you artist. I think I can make it "
951,1:34:20,1:34:24,SPEAKER 4, But also we could also just better do it at a tattoo shop 
952,1:34:24,1:34:28,SPEAKER 1," Before the episode to the episode go to a tattoo shop. Yeah, we could it "
953,1:34:28,1:34:32,SPEAKER 3," We could just have to close just be like yo, can you keep it open? I'd be better for them. Yeah, try to get your equipment up here "
954,1:34:32,1:34:42,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, I like let's do that  Oh, good idea  Sometimes you get great ideas. Oh my god, right here. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait "
955,1:34:45,1:34:52,SPEAKER 2," Left hand you with the reverse get fucked idiot you with the reverse. That's that means don't get too big for your fucking bridges, bro "
956,1:34:52,1:34:59,SPEAKER 4," Okay, I have been meaning to tell you about my secret tattoo  Like I got a secret tattoo  I know well I can show you you're gonna show us on the bonus episode. Oh "
