42,0:05:50,0:05:56,SPEAKER 1," This is probably the the comfiest. I think this is the comfiest hoodie I have right now. No, I'm sure you can't say that "
43,0:05:56,0:06:02,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, but you still can't say you just can't say it because it doesn't sound it because you will eventually sell this product "
44,0:06:02,0:06:08,SPEAKER 4, It doesn't sound genuine. I love about what the thing I love about the hoodie is the price gentleman. I feel like I feel like the price can't

50,0:06:37,0:06:44,SPEAKER 4, I'm afraid of those fifty dollars. You should just say I'm making a five hundred dollar bidet  Well make one and then sell fifty dollars my plan is to make a bunch of them 
51,0:06:44,0:06:56,SPEAKER 3," But I'm gonna go to a much of streamers house and set them up and then they're gonna be like this is amazing  But then when you go to the website like it's like the fifty dollar ones the one you're gonna buy like you could buy the vandal one  But you're not gonna. Yeah, and then they're gonna oh the bait and switch I "
52,0:06:56,0:07:17,SPEAKER 1, To selfishly fueled gift for my parents this year. Uh-huh  It was because I was thinking about before before leaving to go home  I was thinking about how I'm not gonna have a bidet for about a week and a half two weeks  And every time I go back the first time I feel sorry for you. It's awful  It ever since I moved in with you guys and started using bidets every time I go back to the old world 
53,0:07:17,0:07:32,SPEAKER 4," It's it's like it's like it's often moved in with like a bunch of guys who smoke weed  And then he had to not smoke weed for a summer. I changed all of your lives. You do that was a little significant  Yeah, it was so bought you bidet. It's like a job and that was the most significant change you've made in my life "

75,0:10:08,0:10:21,SPEAKER 1," That's  No, and then answered the question with a yes  He asked you a question that you replied no, and then immediately provided another answer that meant the opposite "
76,0:10:21,0:10:27,SPEAKER 4," I did say yeah, he just thinks we're the same he's racist. I'm not done. Oh wait and things all your opinion people are the same "

79,0:10:50,0:10:56,SPEAKER 3, The mud room is the same thing as our our downstairs bathroom. The one room is also what my dad calls his butthole 
80,0:10:58,0:11:09,SPEAKER 1, You know what that you know what I hate about that clip is that we have no idea of that's actually true. I believe it's like  It's the clue expansion canonically could totally actually be what he calls it will be pop all right 
81,0:11:10,0:11:15,SPEAKER 3, This is the same room you guys went in that had that weird elf on the shelf that would yell at you. Oh my goodness 
82,0:11:15,0:11:18,SPEAKER 1, He was loud. We didn't talk about this. I hated that 
83,0:11:19,0:11:24,SPEAKER 4, I hated there is just this inanimate object that would hang on a door and if you walked into a room 
84,0:11:24,0:11:33,SPEAKER 1, It just yelled at you by it by that was my I went to the garage to throw something out  I walked by the by the bathroom and the elf yelled it's not guys. It's a snowman 
85,0:11:33,0:11:38,SPEAKER 3," It's a snowman. It'll say like it'll be like, what are you doing in here actually on second thought? "
86,0:11:38,0:11:40,SPEAKER 1, I don't want to know 
87,0:11:42,0:11:48,SPEAKER 2," Are you all right? You're looking a little flushed, but then what pissed me off his he'll be like get it flush and then "
88,0:11:49,0:11:55,SPEAKER 3, And I'm like fucking god damn little a line was literally like it laughs at every joke. We're like no it doesn't slide. I'm looking over at it 
89,0:11:55,0:11:57,SPEAKER 4, Like that's not funny and here's the reason why 
90,0:11:58,0:12:07,SPEAKER 2," I was I was changing into my underarmored and tell you find somebody that made it to email them to let them know  Yeah, there's no nuance in the joke. You're kind of just like what are you doing in here? I hope the prostate's okay "
91,0:12:08,0:12:33,SPEAKER 3," That's exactly exactly what anyway this room is the same bathroom where my father when we came back in because the garage is right  Actually, he was like come in here and then he pulled down his pants and he was like this is how you peace standing up  Oh, so this is your late father. This is my yeah, it's not my it's not the early one  Yeah, why did you need to be taught this what he I was like nine. Oh you were you were nine "
92,0:12:34,0:12:42,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, right. This is no, this is my father. Wait hold on hold on no back up. It's my late father. You started peeing  You started learning to pee standing up at nine "
93,0:12:43,0:12:52,SPEAKER 3," He that's when he taught me. Yeah, why did you need to be taught to do that? Yeah, well that's great  It's a thing you get taught. I was like three. What? "
94,0:12:52,0:12:57,SPEAKER 2," No, you're not three when you boys learn to pee themselves dude, no, no, no "
95,0:12:59,0:13:03,SPEAKER 3, Zipper you looked up one. They learn to pee themselves. They don't learn that they do that at out the womb 
96,0:13:03,0:13:07,SPEAKER 4, That's true. You didn't haunt. Did you have like you didn't have like the smaller toilet? 
97,0:13:08,0:13:24,SPEAKER 1," I knew how to pee specifically. This is peeing standing. I'm realizing I get that I get what you're saying  It's not an activity that you need to be taught you okay? Okay, let me see if you're capable of standing  You're capable of doing the peeing part. It's like it's like he had Ludwig's first attempt "
98,0:13:24,0:13:26,SPEAKER 4, And he's just like pointing it toward him 
99,0:13:26,0:13:32,SPEAKER 1," And that's like no, no, no, he's not his arms folded  And he's swinging my mouth "
100,0:13:34,0:13:52,SPEAKER 3," No, okay, I think part of the problem was  Your brand the big teaching moment was lifting the seat up because he taught me that there's splash back and it'll stain the bottom  Oh, it perhaps like I had like a I don't maybe they found my toilet upstairs and they're like it's yellow pee staying on the bottom  You have to lift this "
101,0:13:52,0:13:56,SPEAKER 2, Dude your family is weird. I will so he would grab my cock and 
102,0:13:57,0:14:05,SPEAKER 4," And I was about to come on. No, you guys didn't go to church and you learn to pee  Yeah, it's like I went to church and learn to pee we go in the cool room. We go in the pee lessons "
103,0:14:05,0:14:07,SPEAKER 1, Oh father Murphy that's how the Murphy 
104,0:14:10,0:14:23,SPEAKER 2," It's like Tom and Jerry Ludwig's dad just grabs his cock and he like pulls it like a fucking like a violin string  And he goes  But you watch it. Yeah, you watch you watch "
105,0:14:23,0:14:28,SPEAKER 3, Quincy boys also you pee sitting down I well yeah because he taught me and then he died 
106,0:14:28,0:14:32,SPEAKER 4, That you've learned his one lesson and then not you only got through lesson one of your dad 
107,0:14:32,0:14:34,SPEAKER 1, Your dad wasn't there to hold it anymore 
108,0:14:35,0:14:46,SPEAKER 2," So you just kept sitting yeah, so we we lost the the teaching halfway through so that so he this this came from my question  Have you seen your guys is dad's dick and balls? Yes, that was when that I saw it and I was like dude "
109,0:14:46,0:14:52,SPEAKER 4," That's fucking you right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you're that's when you're in what a fat cock you have dad dad you said that "
110,0:14:53,0:15:04,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, dad great shit  Over there. What about you you said you did yeah, how that how that go also bald  This is a perfect match to trace also "
111,0:15:05,0:15:07,SPEAKER 4, When you go ball up on you go ball the matrix 
112,0:15:07,0:15:26,SPEAKER 1," I think it's  When you're when you're a tiny child it shapes your experience because you're like  It's it's gigantic by your perspective  And then I remember I remember like a decade later like I'm a teenager and I'm thinking like  Well, mine ever be that big. Yeah, but that is "
113,0:15:27,0:15:31,SPEAKER 2, Can you imagine it right now imagine your father? Hey everyone at home also imagine your father's dick 
114,0:15:32,0:15:37,SPEAKER 3, For the audio listeners. Can you can you so I'm supposing his eyes like he's making a wish 
115,0:15:40,0:15:43,SPEAKER 1," He's imagining the turtle thing right now. Yeah, the turtle thing "
116,0:15:44,0:15:46,SPEAKER 3, Do you think if a kid saw your dick right now. It's the size 
117,0:15:49,0:15:54,SPEAKER 4, That  I might be a redacted bitch 
118,0:15:54,0:15:59,SPEAKER 2, Usually he doesn't break usually he doesn't break and I love when Ludwig breaks 
119,0:15:59,0:16:02,SPEAKER 1, But it's like snl so social experience but actually 
120,0:16:03,0:16:08,SPEAKER 2," Yes, yeah, absolutely we talked about this before they're like they're just giant like god damned like "
121,0:16:09,0:16:16,SPEAKER 3, Grecian statues showing my adult penis the children for science. I saw it on the trailer for the new season in Nathan for you

126,0:16:41,0:16:43,SPEAKER 4, I did guess what a didn't also didn't do 
127,0:16:43,0:16:47,SPEAKER 1, You really didn't know I got you so it's just not here. It's just not here in time 
128,0:16:47,0:16:52,SPEAKER 3," Well, okay, how about you say the gifts you got and I'll tell you my gifts because they're not physical "

151,0:20:09,0:20:11,SPEAKER 2, I'm talking so it's like it's like adult coloring books 
152,0:20:11,0:20:18,SPEAKER 4, It's like just doing an activity. That thing is gaming is my life. I'm like you. It's a little bit different  I get that but this distract me from my life. I don't

162,0:21:25,0:21:29,SPEAKER 3, And I think that's why it makes it hard to buy gifts for him. He's great to get gifts for because you can get him literally anything 
163,0:21:29,0:21:46,SPEAKER 4," And his reaction will always be the same. Yeah, it's true. He's just hurts. He's easy to not feel guilty buying a bad gift  Think that's true. Oh, I'm opening your gift right now  But also I saw his gift like so this is from me and zipper two as are all of my gifts wow  Because that is an excuse to buy one gift "
164,0:21:49,0:22:03,SPEAKER 3," I should do that cutie got everyone such good gifts. I I am part of that  Go get him then she got aiden a signed copy of the social network. Yeah, but Jesse Eisenberg the screenplay sick  That was for me too. It was thank you "

Yeah, and we had like boxes and boxes "
172,0:22:56,0:23:01,SPEAKER 1, That was it that was at the beginning of quarantine and it was the beginning of my arc of realizing that no one

174,0:23:12,0:23:19,SPEAKER 3, I'm sorry dude  It says together with Adidas. We created something that did not exist before and completely projected the future 
175,0:23:23,0:23:27,SPEAKER 4, Imagine their face when they found out there's other talking my hoodie down. They're like wait a minute 
176,0:23:27,0:23:29,SPEAKER 2, I swear with a hood on it

He's like, no, oh sometimes I'm like you're troll "
179,0:23:49,0:23:54,SPEAKER 1," No, I'm video drum guy right now. I buy I buy the least things in the house 100% that is not "
180,0:23:54,0:24:04,SPEAKER 4," But it doesn't mean that it doesn't mean that if you would have said that I would have been oh, maybe that's true  But you but you said I don't like buying things that's what you said and I'm like you're an idiot "
181,0:24:04,0:24:18,SPEAKER 1," I'm in it in like a quantifiable sense. I think I I  Compare it up to people in third world countries or something. No, no, no, just I feel like I don't buy a lot of items in general  But I'm happy when I buy something that I'm really excited about "
182,0:24:19,0:24:23,SPEAKER 4, Like a big ol like but I don't make a lot of I just think it once again is capping 
183,0:24:23,0:24:27,SPEAKER 3," He's coming across to normal. He took me to subway next gift. Oh, no way. Oh "
184,0:24:30,0:24:32,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, next gift right did you eat? Yeah, so "
185,0:24:33,0:24:40,SPEAKER 4," Unfortunately, your gift was locked in my COVID dungeon and I couldn't wrap it because I didn't have a wrap "
186,0:24:40,0:24:49,SPEAKER 2," That's okay, so your gift is not we could have given you wrapping paper that you just kept an eight or whatever  I mean you didn't want to do that and that's makes you bad friend. Well, I also got code like a couple days before "
187,0:24:49,0:25:00,SPEAKER 4," I don't even know if it was here on time. I think about this one got here's the latest it's here some sizzies  It's a box. No, he needs a kitchen knife. Um, I'll also say this is the most unfortunate gift that I got "

189,0:25:02,0:25:08,SPEAKER 2," You'll see a duplicate maybe oh, no, it's climbing shoes "

What happens going on is I got climbing shoes from my sister for Christmas  I've been climbing for a while and I have everyone always said  You got to get climbing shoes the rental suck and I've always had this theory that it's like I'm gonna wait  To get really good at climbing and then when I get my climbing shoes. I'm gonna have a power up "
191,0:25:35,0:25:38,SPEAKER 2," You didn't fucking wait to get a pizza stone. Yeah, I know "
192,0:25:38,0:25:56,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, and I told people this and they all said I'm dumb as fuck my sister gets me shoes. I'm fogging  I try them on  Like a hair type and the way climate shoes work is you're supposed to start above your size and then eventually work  Below your size like a ballerina is supposed to force it down "
193,0:25:56,0:26:13,SPEAKER 4," I think those are gonna fit like a dream. Love it because I went and I looked at all your shoes. Does the slipper fit  That's what these are also a different style. You're your double sock right now. I'm gonna need you to take one of the socks  You're smoking a single of absolute reverb. Why would you wear double?  It looks like the looks like that part on the ankle looks like another sock, but do people do that for like boots sometimes? "
194,0:26:13,0:26:22,SPEAKER 3," Oh, yeah. Oh, it's a glove. It's a glove. You know my foot. You know my foot so well  That is like four skinned for your foot and this is a different style of shoe because this one's a curved one "

197,0:26:37,0:26:42,SPEAKER 2, You don't know about this yet. Retribution means that you're trying to make something right because you're wrong Tim 
198,0:26:42,0:26:57,SPEAKER 3," This is payment  Because you gave my mother COVID-19. No  She was confirmed  Positive two days ago. I don't wait when two days ago. I feel so bad about that. I mean, it's probably not him "

261,0:32:42,0:32:49,SPEAKER 2," And then I typed out the sentence of what happened.  And I was like, that's crazy that this is happening again  in my life. "
262,0:32:49,0:32:49,SPEAKER 4," Wait, what's happening? "
263,0:32:49,0:32:59,SPEAKER 2," Well, basically, it's just more the idea  that like I had to relive the experience  kind of like Zane in the content piece  of like explaining what happened.  Because I already explained it on the podcast.  And I explained it to you because you didn't listen to it. "
264,0:32:59,0:33:00,SPEAKER 4," I see you had to, I see your saying. "
265,0:33:00,0:33:04,SPEAKER 2," And yeah, well, you're great.  We all like you a lot, man. "
266,0:33:04,0:33:05,SPEAKER 3," Thanks, man. "
267,0:33:05,0:33:08,SPEAKER 4," I couldn't believe, I was like, I gotta watch this episode. "
268,0:33:08,0:33:09,SPEAKER 1," I was like, I couldn't believe, "
269,0:33:09,0:33:16,SPEAKER 4," I was a fan for a moment where I was like, he did what?  I'm like, I gotta fight it.  And I watched that section much more. "
270,0:33:16,0:33:29,SPEAKER 2," Here, we have a whiteboard where I write the topics  that we want to talk about.  And Loto, he's like, okay, can you write airplane, man?  And then he's like, question Mark?  Because he literally can't process all of the words  in something if it's not a clickbait title. "
271,0:33:29,0:33:33,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, love, we also will clickbait us  every week with topics.  He doesn't tell us any of his topics,  which is respectable. "
272,0:33:33,0:33:35,SPEAKER 3, I like it lock and key. 
273,0:33:35,0:33:35,SPEAKER 1, It's fine. 
274,0:33:35,0:33:36,SPEAKER 3, Are there any more gifts? 
275,0:33:36,0:33:38,SPEAKER 2," Yes, me. "
276,0:33:38,0:33:41,SPEAKER 1," So I have a question.  Are we still gonna, are we still gonna say  the gifts that are on the way? "
277,0:33:41,0:33:42,SPEAKER 2, What do you want to do? 
278,0:33:42,0:33:43,SPEAKER 1, It's up to you. 
279,0:33:43,0:33:46,SPEAKER 4," Okay, I think it's lame if we don't tell me my gifts.  Okay. "
280,0:33:46,0:33:52,SPEAKER 1," I want mine to say it.  No, I have yours.  I wanted to say yours now because it's related  to what you just received. "
281,0:33:52,0:33:58,SPEAKER 2," I want you to say it, but I want you to present it  with like, orally.  I want you to like make a, "
282,0:33:58,0:34:00,SPEAKER 4, I want you to present it to my penis like a microphone. 
283,0:34:00,0:34:06,SPEAKER 2," I want you to speak into the glands of my penis.  No, I want you to pitch it like you're selling me something. "
284,0:34:06,0:34:33,SPEAKER 1," Okay, so you got the coffee table  to end all coffee table books.  But what if, what's even better than one coffee table book,  two coffee table books of your favorite,  of your favorite literary things, the works of prezo,  and your favorite visual things, monkeys,  and apes.  Really?  I got you a hardcover coffee table book  of gorillas and monkeys. "
285,0:34:33,0:34:36,SPEAKER 3, Don't judge it up by saying hardcover. 
286,0:34:36,0:34:40,SPEAKER 1," It's hardcover, because I had the choice.  There was a paperback version "
287,0:34:40,0:34:42,SPEAKER 2, and you would have gotten paperbacked. 
288,0:34:42,0:34:44,SPEAKER 3," If you skipped out,  I'll work in a hardcover one. "
289,0:34:44,0:34:46,SPEAKER 1, It's a cycle path.  Because I splurge for you. 
290,0:34:46,0:34:48,SPEAKER 4," I always get my paperback, you know what I'm saying? "
291,0:34:48,0:34:58,SPEAKER 2," That was great of you to do that for me.  Actually, Nick has the, he got me on the books  in his room, he has a little coffee table,  and he has this book of like all curbies ever. "
292,0:34:58,0:34:59,SPEAKER 4, It's like all the curbies ever drawing. 
293,0:34:59,0:35:01,SPEAKER 2," And I'm like, fuck you, why do you have that?  I want that so better. "
294,0:35:01,0:35:04,SPEAKER 1," Hey.  Yeah, so you have a monkey book on what? "
295,0:35:04,0:35:06,SPEAKER 2, I like that.  Thank you for the monkey book.

299,0:35:10,0:35:12,SPEAKER 1," Okay, so I had, I didn't know, "
300,0:35:12,0:35:15,SPEAKER 2, but Ludwig likes anime. 
301,0:35:15,0:35:22,SPEAKER 1, No.  Ludwig loves an anime or two.  I watch animated Japanese artists.  Animated Japanese TV shows.  He likes those from the pwn desk. 
302,0:35:22,0:35:22,SPEAKER 2, That's neat. 
303,0:35:22,0:35:30,SPEAKER 1," It's a place that he thinks is really cool  and has like a lot of like firms just for cultural.  Randy O'Sa pin you about, even though he's never been there. "
304,0:35:30,0:35:31,SPEAKER 4, We should travel that.  Even though he's the first time. 
305,0:35:31,0:35:34,SPEAKER 2," Would you like that if we like,  we went to where they make those cartoons? "
306,0:35:34,0:35:35,SPEAKER 1, I'm a loof. 
307,0:35:35,0:35:36,SPEAKER 4," Oh, I see. "
308,0:35:36,0:35:36,SPEAKER 2, I'm a loof. 
309,0:35:36,0:35:38,SPEAKER 1," It's the one you're looking for, but it happens "
310,0:35:38,0:35:39,SPEAKER 3, at a thousand. 
311,0:35:39,0:35:41,SPEAKER 4, Where is that guy from? 
312,0:35:41,0:35:42,SPEAKER 2, He just watched Aladdin. 
313,0:35:42,0:35:53,SPEAKER 1, You've watched a lot of anime.  And I didn't know your favorite one.  So I had somebody scout for me.  Ooh.  And I believe it is welcome to the NHK. 
314,0:35:53,0:35:53,SPEAKER 3, Stop there. 
315,0:35:53,0:36:01,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, and I bought you a rare figurine  from welcome to the NHK that they only sold in Japan. "
316,0:36:01,0:36:02,SPEAKER 3," Of who, which character? "
317,0:36:02,0:36:04,SPEAKER 1, I don't know. 
318,0:36:04,0:36:05,SPEAKER 3, That's the excitement. 
319,0:36:05,0:36:12,SPEAKER 1," It's the mean, it's the mean character.  It's one of the, there's two main characters  like a boy and a girl, right?  It's the girl. "
320,0:36:12,0:36:14,SPEAKER 4, Ooh.  You bought him a cool floor toy. 
321,0:36:14,0:36:15,SPEAKER 1, Hey.  He comes in a cool box. 
322,0:36:15,0:36:19,SPEAKER 2, I can't wait till it ends up on the ground  or in the garage wet. 
323,0:36:19,0:36:22,SPEAKER 4," Because you know, a lot of them in his figurines,  they always end up in a nice place. "
324,0:36:22,0:36:41,SPEAKER 1," On that topic, it is really our garage right now  is a nightmare.  And when you go, all of these things  from Ludwig's stream room are piled around the garage  in this like pathway that you kind of have to carve through  to get to our weights.  Where, because, you know, occasionally,  we work out in the garage. "
325,0:36:41,0:36:43,SPEAKER 3, The garage gets to the five pound weights.  It ain't that big of a deal. 
326,0:36:43,0:36:52,SPEAKER 1," It's the Ludwig's house.  You know what, you say that the five pound ones  are literally the hardest ones to get to  because they're behind everything  at the back of the garage.  He's just a lift though. "
327,0:36:52,0:36:56,SPEAKER 2," It's more about the journey than the, yeah, it sucks.  I mean, I hope that you are serious. "
328,0:36:56,0:37:01,SPEAKER 3, I'm doing my ultimate auction stream this Wednesday  where I'm selling all of the items for charity. 
329,0:37:01,0:37:09,SPEAKER 1," All over this room is all the shit  that used to be in your stream room, right?  So there's, there's fucking, there's like balls.  There's shells. "
330,0:37:09,0:37:13,SPEAKER 4," Hey, we should, we should all three of us  should get one, we should go in there and get one thing. "
331,0:37:13,0:37:14,SPEAKER 2," Ooh, can we get a free thing? "
332,0:37:14,0:37:16,SPEAKER 1, I would love that.  I would love that. 
333,0:37:16,0:37:17,SPEAKER 4, You guys are going to get one thing. 
334,0:37:17,0:37:44,SPEAKER 1," Lane, Lane in the garage, all over the place.  Not just, not just cheap things  that you've kind of tossed aside, right?

I'm literally looking at a $5,000 fucking dollar copy  of Ocarina of Time on our fucking Samsung  version garage.  15K.  That's right.  Yeah, it's sitting on the floor of the fucking garage  where it floods when it rains. "
335,0:37:44,0:37:49,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, it rained for like eight days straight over,  over the holidays and, uh, and yeah, "
336,0:37:49,0:37:50,SPEAKER 3," yeah, it rains, it pours. "
337,0:37:50,0:37:54,SPEAKER 2," So yeah, let's, we get one free thing.  No, no, yeah. "
338,0:37:54,0:37:59,SPEAKER 3," They're going to charity.  You do, you, I'll, I'll give you a list  of a lot of items you could pick from. "
339,0:37:59,0:38:01,SPEAKER 1," 10, that list be the N64 games. "
340,0:38:01,0:38:02,SPEAKER 3," No, it cannot. "
341,0:38:02,0:38:05,SPEAKER 2," Wait, so what the fuck is a foster kid  going to do with goddamn Zelda? "
342,0:38:05,0:38:07,SPEAKER 4," You said, you're saying, I don't know.  They're Mario 44. "
343,0:38:07,0:38:14,SPEAKER 3," The stream is, I'm getting all of the things  and then I'm auctioning them to my chat.  They can buy something for me directly.  Okay. "
344,0:38:14,0:38:21,SPEAKER 2, And the money goes into a slush fund  and it's a dark money that's funneled into our corporation  and we take the money and then we steal it. 
345,0:38:21,0:38:23,SPEAKER 3," Okay, actually though, question. "
346,0:38:23,0:38:24,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
347,0:38:24,0:38:25,SPEAKER 3, Is that how it works? 
348,0:38:25,0:38:28,SPEAKER 2, It can. 
349,0:38:28,0:38:32,SPEAKER 3," Uh, I, I want to give you your gift.  Okay, full employment. "
350,0:38:32,0:38:34,SPEAKER 2," Hey, and he's okay with that. "
351,0:38:34,0:38:36,SPEAKER 3," And I do for gift, same shit, full employment. "
352,0:38:36,0:38:38,SPEAKER 1," Not he, he's downplaying it. "
353,0:38:38,0:38:40,SPEAKER 4," Just to be clear, I didn't get one. "
354,0:38:40,0:38:41,SPEAKER 3, Your gift is coming. 
355,0:38:41,0:38:42,SPEAKER 2, But you also got that. 
356,0:38:42,0:38:46,SPEAKER 1," Well, you're fired.  He got me, he got me a 20% raise. "

376,0:39:32,0:39:39,SPEAKER 2," If you guys don't know, Nick is a dirty little butt slut  for Psychonauts. "
377,0:39:39,0:39:40,SPEAKER 4, I just like the game. 
378,0:39:41,0:39:45,SPEAKER 2, You would let that guy come and prick in your mouth. 
379,0:39:45,0:39:45,SPEAKER 3, I would. 
380,0:39:45,0:39:47,SPEAKER 1, Rooting the gift. 
381,0:39:48,0:39:49,SPEAKER 3, Would you wear this shirt? 
382,0:39:49,0:39:54,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, this is tight.  Yeah, I'd wear like a black thing over it. "
383,0:39:54,0:39:56,SPEAKER 1," It's a, it's a true thing. "

385,0:40:01,0:40:07,SPEAKER 4, The funny part of the shirt is that it's a haze shirt.  That's the funny part.  Is that it's clearly made by someone? 
386,0:40:07,0:40:08,SPEAKER 3, If it's good enough for Jordan. 
387,0:40:08,0:40:19,SPEAKER 1," No, it came with the game.  What?  Yeah, I looked this up.  They released a limited amount of these shirts  with the game.  They made that.  Yeah.  That's even better.  Yeah, this is official. "
388,0:40:19,0:40:21,SPEAKER 2," You should say that.  Yeah, I thought it was a shirt. "
389,0:40:21,0:40:31,SPEAKER 1," Oh, why that?  No, it's official.  This is a tie.  Thank you.  When they released a game, the game,  they released a limited amount of these  with certain.  Where's they don't have a custom tie? "

391,0:40:35,0:40:39,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, I never played the game.  Can you go inside someone's prostate, kind of fuck around? "
392,0:40:39,0:40:49,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, kind of, yeah.  Yeah, the whole idea of the game is, like, one of those balls.  You're like this little kid with powers  and you jump into people's brains  and you fight their demons  and those are all the dungeons in the game, essentially. "
393,0:40:49,0:40:49,SPEAKER 1," Wow, that is actually simple. "
394,0:40:49,0:40:55,SPEAKER 4," So you're kind of doing that.  Yeah, and this one guy was, like, his demon is his prostate  and he needs it mill. "

414,0:41:44,0:41:46,SPEAKER 2, You got to hang out with funky to get your work done. 
415,0:41:46,0:41:48,SPEAKER 1," And this is one of those things  where it's like, should I open this "

418,0:41:51,0:41:53,SPEAKER 3," Now, working's getting funky, huh? "
419,0:41:55,0:41:56,SPEAKER 2, You read the box.

422,0:41:58,0:42:01,SPEAKER 1," Yeah.  Dude, this is super cute. "
423,0:42:01,0:42:04,SPEAKER 2, I wanted you to get something  you could actually fucking use  and not put on a gift. 
424,0:42:04,0:42:06,SPEAKER 1, You could be able to write so fast. 
425,0:42:06,0:42:10,SPEAKER 2, Yeah.  That is the fastest that in peaches and daisies. 
426,0:42:10,0:42:13,SPEAKER 3, It's the next year's product to see  if Damon remembers what it was.

443,0:42:57,0:42:58,SPEAKER 3, I don't even want to open it anymore. 
444,0:42:58,0:43:00,SPEAKER 2, You like boxing?  You can just keep the box. 
445,0:43:00,0:43:01,SPEAKER 4, I want to eat this box. 
446,0:43:01,0:43:04,SPEAKER 3, Oh my god.  This box is so touchy.

455,0:43:30,0:43:34,SPEAKER 3," Okay, wait.  It's Jigglypuff. "
456,0:43:34,0:43:38,SPEAKER 1," Yes.  Oh, no. "
457,0:43:38,0:43:39,SPEAKER 3, No chalk back. 
458,0:43:39,0:43:41,SPEAKER 1," Oh, that's so tight. "
459,0:43:41,0:43:47,SPEAKER 3," For climbing, you put chalk in a bag  and it's just a Jigglypuff one.  That's tight.  That's really cute. "
460,0:43:47,0:43:48,SPEAKER 1, They sculled a puff. 
461,0:43:48,0:43:52,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, they scooped out all the puffs of brains  and inside. "
462,0:43:52,0:43:53,SPEAKER 1, It's a real Jigglypuff. 
463,0:43:53,0:43:55,SPEAKER 3, They hold it around on the puff cream. 
464,0:43:55,0:43:56,SPEAKER 2, And then we made chocolates out of the cream. 
465,0:43:56,0:44:00,SPEAKER 4, That's pretty legit.  You're gonna be so fucking bricked up. 
466,0:44:00,0:44:01,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
467,0:44:01,0:44:02,SPEAKER 4," Well, okay. "
468,0:44:02,0:44:05,SPEAKER 2," You come through, hey boys, what's up?  Where's the theme to? "
469,0:44:05,0:44:20,SPEAKER 3," Only problem with this?  Okay, fuck you.  Is that at the climbing gym, I have a problem  that I remedied.  The problem is people come up to me  and when I climb alone, I hate it  because they're not big lot of big fans  and then they climb the climb right after me.  I bitch about this on the pod. "
470,0:44:20,0:44:21,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
471,0:44:21,0:44:25,SPEAKER 3," So I go with a hat and a mask now, works perfect.  Only one person's never recognized me. "
472,0:44:25,0:44:28,SPEAKER 2, You look like the bully in a blue Valentine. 
473,0:44:28,0:44:41,SPEAKER 3," I'll give you an example.  I went to the climbing gym without the hat on  with Aiden the other day.  And five people went up to Aiden separately  and said, hey man, love the yard. "
474,0:44:41,0:44:42,SPEAKER 1, Wow. 
475,0:44:42,0:44:45,SPEAKER 3," One of them followed up with, who's this fucking guy? "
476,0:44:45,0:44:47,SPEAKER 2, Don't do that.  You are annoying. 
477,0:44:47,0:44:56,SPEAKER 3," People in a row walked up to Aiden.  They were all in a group and they ran the fun joke  of I recognize Aiden, but who's with them? "
478,0:44:56,0:45:00,SPEAKER 4," Well, I went to the climbing gym today  and someone came up and said, are you Aiden? "
479,0:45:00,0:45:01,SPEAKER 1, No. 
480,0:45:01,0:45:02,SPEAKER 4, So Aiden's getting a lot of love. 
481,0:45:02,0:45:05,SPEAKER 1," Yeah.  You know, it's the hottest.  It's the hottest. "
482,0:45:05,0:45:36,SPEAKER 2," I went to get lunch with Dan that he works at BTS  and we got food it was yesterday  and there's like a hovering group of high school kids  to him come like, are you slime?  Like we didn't know if it was you.  I was like, yeah, I thought it was a bald guy, huh?  They're like, yes.  And I'm like, could we get a picture?  Well, yeah, sure.  I was like, but this is Dan.  He's much more interesting than me  and he needs to be in the picture too.  So I made these two kids take a picture with him,  to me and Dan and we're just,  and I'm just standing there like,  and I was like, this is like a metal gear.  Like we're going off to war. "
483,0:45:36,0:45:38,SPEAKER 4, This thing got a photo of the doctor.  That's pretty cool. 
484,0:45:38,0:45:46,SPEAKER 3," Anyway, I bring that up because you know what?  It actually won't be that bad.  If someone knows that I'm me,  even if I have my disguise on,  because they see the thing. "
485,0:45:46,0:45:48,SPEAKER 4," You also don't have to wear the,  I don't ever wear my guard fan. "
486,0:45:48,0:45:53,SPEAKER 2, I think it's really hard to buy Ludwig something  or get him something that he will genuinely 
487,0:45:53,0:45:56,SPEAKER 4, like use more than he got into climbing. 
488,0:45:56,0:45:57,SPEAKER 2, You know what I'm saying? 
489,0:45:57,0:46:01,SPEAKER 1, You know what thing?  He better start using soon.  Have you seen this yet?  Come on.  The Vespa.

493,0:46:04,0:46:05,SPEAKER 2, It's in the garage. 
494,0:46:05,0:46:06,SPEAKER 3, I got a Vespa. 
495,0:46:06,0:46:09,SPEAKER 1, We got a hot new Vespa sitting in the garage  ready to get rid of it. 
496,0:46:09,0:46:13,SPEAKER 3," No, because it needs to have oil changed  and we don't have the oil yet  and then it also needs gas. "
497,0:46:13,0:46:16,SPEAKER 2," Oh, she asked me to change oil  because I'm the man of the house. "
498,0:46:16,0:46:17,SPEAKER 4, Put some vegetable oil in it. 
499,0:46:17,0:46:19,SPEAKER 3," Okay, you've never changed a catalytic converter. "
500,0:46:19,0:46:22,SPEAKER 2, You change oil like in a real car. 
501,0:46:22,0:46:25,SPEAKER 4," A lot.  A catalytic converter, bro.  Who cares? "
502,0:46:25,0:46:26,SPEAKER 1, It's fucking right.

And we didn't stop until 6 a.m.  And we cute.  We just viewed over and over and over it from 2 p.m. to 6 a.m.  You just ripped to two and we only lost two games. "
568,0:50:03,0:50:04,SPEAKER 1," Oh, okay. "
569,0:50:04,0:50:19,SPEAKER 4, And it was the moot.  It was like an eight.  It was like an 18 game win streak.  Like it was the most insane.  I went from like it was the most elo I've ever gone in a night.  It was crazy.  And we were like on cloud nine.  We get off.  It sticks. 
570,0:50:19,0:50:20,SPEAKER 1," We're like, we're not tired yet. "

575,0:50:27,0:51:30,SPEAKER 4," So best day of gaming maybe in my entire career.  Wow.  And then the next day, we get on Valorant again.  And we get one 13 by a team.  So we get fucking annihilated by the best smurfs of all time.  And it was painful.  It was like, it was just like, oh, we can't do anything.  They're just better in every way.  And then we instantly queue into five cheaters.  Really?  Like the most blatant cheating I've ever experienced.  Like the round starts and a bullet hits you through a wall  in the fucking head.  Oh, that's so funny.  Just fine.  And they're all cheating.  We're just like, why?  Why is this happening?  We have, but they keep it close on purpose.  Like the game goes like 13 to 10 and they win.  So it was like over an hour.  And it was just so frustrating.  And we all just go, we don't want to play about it anymore.  We all get off line independently.  And then I just queue mainly and I play jigglypuff.  And I just sink.  I just sink.  I just go to the sunken place.  And I just for hour and people are in the call,  like no one's gaming now.  And everyone's just watching me do this.  And then I get a rest. "
576,0:51:30,0:51:31,SPEAKER 1, You just watch Nick. 
577,0:51:31,0:51:34,SPEAKER 4," I get a rest and everyone in the call goes, oh, what the fuck "
578,0:51:34,0:51:35,SPEAKER 1, is going on? 
579,0:51:35,0:51:50,SPEAKER 4," And I'm like, I know, I know.  And someone's like, you feel good about that?  I'm like, I don't.  And we just keep, we do this for like two hours.  And then Dawson joins the call.  And he's just like, what's going on in here?  And I'm like, don't fucking ask.  He's like, you guys, you're fucking,  you guys, you just fucking relax. "
580,0:51:50,0:51:54,SPEAKER 2," It's like you walked in and everyone just got a fucking  heroin needle in their arm and like, fuck you. "
581,0:51:54,0:52:05,SPEAKER 4," It was on ironically.  So I was being in my room for,  I was in my room for 12 days straight.  I didn't leave my room once.  Very depressing.  It's like very just hard to do.  And that was the darkest day I had. "
582,0:52:05,0:52:06,SPEAKER 2, I'm built different. 
583,0:52:06,0:52:07,SPEAKER 1, I could have done it. 
584,0:52:07,0:52:12,SPEAKER 4," I mean, when you don't have the option to leave,  it's different than like just accidentally  spending a lot of days in your room. "
585,0:52:12,0:52:14,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.  You have pretty much the ideal room. 
586,0:52:14,0:52:22,SPEAKER 4," It was I, yeah, I thought I had an ideal set up,  but it was just like my dad.  I wish I could see a person in real life.  I wish I could go outside for a second.  Yeah.  All right, you guys, I get it. "
587,0:52:22,0:52:23,SPEAKER 1, You're fucking fine. 
588,0:52:23,0:52:26,SPEAKER 3, You would be miserable.  I did it for 30 days.  Can do it again. 
589,0:52:26,0:52:27,SPEAKER 2, Shut the fuck up. 
590,0:52:27,0:52:28,SPEAKER 4, You did not leave your room. 
591,0:52:28,0:52:29,SPEAKER 1, That's not what happened. 
592,0:52:29,0:52:30,SPEAKER 4, You left your room a time. 
593,0:52:30,0:52:32,SPEAKER 2, I'm reading my present book.  It's tired of you. 
594,0:52:32,0:52:33,SPEAKER 1, You're all in the place. 
595,0:52:33,0:52:34,SPEAKER 4, I need to calm down. 
596,0:52:34,0:52:36,SPEAKER 3, I've gone to the present book.  But only gambling. 
597,0:52:36,0:52:45,SPEAKER 4," That was the darkest day for sure, was that day of gaming,  where we just got clobbered and cheated on constantly,  and I haven't been that low in a while. "
598,0:52:45,0:52:56,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, it reminds me a lot of Aiden,  when we were back in the old house, and he was like,  he was two separate days.  He was like, I won every game I had played.  He played League, he played Mogey, and he was like,  it was a good day. "
599,0:52:56,0:52:56,SPEAKER 1, That was a great day. 
600,0:52:56,0:53:03,SPEAKER 2," And then he had another day.  He was like, remember that day I told you about?  This was the opposite.  Everything sucks.  I'm sad. "
601,0:53:03,0:53:06,SPEAKER 3," You're back on the gaming train, and I'm scared. "
602,0:53:06,0:53:07,SPEAKER 4, It was gaming. 
603,0:53:07,0:53:10,SPEAKER 3, I feel like you for a while quit. 
604,0:53:10,0:53:11,SPEAKER 1, Yes. 
605,0:53:11,0:53:32,SPEAKER 3," And your mood before you quit was definitely based  on how your gaming was going.  And it was like, if the game was going good,  you were kind of neutral.  That day was bad.  That day later, you were sad and mad.  And then when you quit, it was like, you know,  you're always kind of at like a neutral state.  And now I feel like you're going to go back  to move swing Aiman. "
606,0:53:32,0:53:37,SPEAKER 2," No, why do we need to stable home, okay?  And you being on the rift and the rant, "
607,0:53:37,0:53:38,SPEAKER 1, not gonna break through. 
608,0:53:38,0:53:40,SPEAKER 3, Can't make a house out of a house. 
609,0:53:40,0:53:41,SPEAKER 4," Oh, you had a break through. "
610,0:53:41,0:53:43,SPEAKER 2, He's looking at his crosshair now. 
611,0:53:43,0:53:45,SPEAKER 1," No, that's not what I said. "
612,0:53:45,0:53:48,SPEAKER 4," Wait, what did you break through? "
613,0:53:48,0:53:51,SPEAKER 3," The breakthroughs, it's not even worth.  It's just a valorant break. "
614,0:53:51,0:53:55,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, it's like a very valorant specific break here.  I found out how to peek angles better. "
615,0:53:55,0:54:41,SPEAKER 2," Also, so Aiman, it's funny.  I cracked him open a couple of weeks ago.  I wanted to be in a car with you and tell you my theory  because I cracked him open.  And I was like, I get you now.  And I was like, here's the thing, you are so measured  and you are so even keel all the time  because you have a binary.  There's this giant bucket where everything you are like,  nah, that's okay, right?  That's all right.  But when something is outside of that bucket  because you are so used to just,  it's saying a lot of things are okay.  If something is slightly out of that bucket  and is annoying to you, it really hurts.  And you flip out, you know, that Aiman.  And he, I explained this to him and he looked at me,  started laughing and he's like,  fucking, I hate that you're right.  And then I did a victory lap around the kitchen. "
616,0:54:41,0:54:42,SPEAKER 4, I definitely gave it to him. 
617,0:54:42,0:54:52,SPEAKER 1," I said it because I thought about it for a while.  And I was like, this is the first time  that you have made a grandiose about my personality. "
618,0:54:54,0:55:05,SPEAKER 4," Oh man.  And I was like, you're right.  You've also, what you've done is validated his sense  about you.  Like, when he gets that like spotty sense about you,  you've sort of just validated it. "
619,0:55:05,0:55:07,SPEAKER 1," See, that's the problem because then he says that, right? "
620,0:55:07,0:55:08,SPEAKER 2, As long as you didn't write. 
621,0:55:08,0:55:12,SPEAKER 1," I said we're the same.  We're the same, we're the same.  We're the same.  We're the same. "
622,0:55:12,0:55:19,SPEAKER 2," I said we're the same.  And then he'd be like, no, we're not.  And then he'd come up in a week later and be like,  we're the same.  And that really happened. "
623,0:55:19,0:55:29,SPEAKER 3," I remember we went to Austin and we went to a coffee shop  in Texas.  And then you said we're the same.  And then you left for a bit.  And then he was like, we're not the same. "
624,0:55:30,0:55:33,SPEAKER 4, I've had that exact exact same moment. 
625,0:55:33,0:55:52,SPEAKER 3," You know what else happened with Aidan funny Aidan story?  He goes, he goes, he's telling some story about some  friend he has, he goes, he has a wide berth of friends.  And that was a sentence you said out loud and defended.  And he thought it meant like a large variety of friends  from different backgrounds in upbringing. "
626,0:55:52,0:55:56,SPEAKER 2," Zipper, can we, can we get some help?  Because I don't know this either.  He could say that and I would've been like, yes, sure. "
627,0:55:56,0:56:00,SPEAKER 3," He meant breadth.  Oh, he just used the word berth. "
628,0:56:00,0:56:02,SPEAKER 1," But berth is like a, what is it? "
629,0:56:02,0:56:03,SPEAKER 2," Berth, like B-E-R-T-A. "
630,0:56:03,0:56:07,SPEAKER 3," Berth is like staying, it's like docking a ship. "
631,0:56:07,0:56:11,SPEAKER 4," No, it's a ship's a lot in place at a wharf or dock.  Yeah, that's what you meant. "
632,0:56:11,0:56:12,SPEAKER 2, You got a wide ship. 
633,0:56:12,0:56:16,SPEAKER 3, He tried to use that exact sentence to defend it. 
634,0:56:16,0:56:24,SPEAKER 2," Aidan's funny because you'd be like,  that word doesn't mean that.  And he'd be like, yeah, it does.  Or he'll be like, oh, it's like, why are you telling me this? "
635,0:56:24,0:56:26,SPEAKER 4," No, no, no, no, he would say is.  But you got what I meant. "
636,0:56:26,0:56:29,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, that's what he was saying.  He could just be like, oh, I got it wrong. "
637,0:56:29,0:56:30,SPEAKER 1, Or even he knows that he's not language does. 
638,0:56:30,0:56:31,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, I got it wrong. "
639,0:56:31,0:56:33,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.  Which is what it's for. 
640,0:56:33,0:56:35,SPEAKER 2," And now he's ascended, I'm proud of him. "
641,0:56:35,0:56:37,SPEAKER 4," Aidan's fucking language-pilled, dude.  I like you, man.  I like you, man. "
642,0:56:37,0:56:46,SPEAKER 2," I like you, man.  You know, one of my resolutions is,  one of them I can't tell the podcast  because people will try to ruin it for me.  But I want to tell my friends I love them more. "
643,0:56:46,0:56:47,SPEAKER 1, Wow. 
644,0:56:47,0:56:49,SPEAKER 4," Like it's love we wear in the real way.  No, in the real way. "
645,0:56:49,0:56:51,SPEAKER 3," I love you, guys.  And Carl Jacobs. "
646,0:56:51,0:56:51,SPEAKER 2, That's fuck up. 
647,0:56:51,0:56:54,SPEAKER 1, Love it.  Love it equally.  Damn you. 
648,0:56:54,0:56:59,SPEAKER 3, I think I am a believer in you should write down  your New Year's resolutions. 
649,0:56:59,0:57:00,SPEAKER 1," Yes, I did that, too. "
650,0:57:00,0:57:08,SPEAKER 3," If anyone's watching, I did that back in the day  and it's a better way to actualize them.  So maybe right now, if you're driving stuff, "
651,0:57:08,0:57:11,SPEAKER 4, you wrote them down and then it was ended up like folded  and like under his desk. 
652,0:57:11,0:57:16,SPEAKER 1," Or if you don't have time to stop,  maybe just try to write them down while you're driving.  Maybe just try to- "
653,0:57:16,0:57:18,SPEAKER 3," Hey, that's a great tip. "
654,0:57:18,0:57:20,SPEAKER 2, We're going to someone fucking with a camera 
655,0:57:20,0:57:21,SPEAKER 4, like they're fun to do it. 
656,0:57:21,0:57:24,SPEAKER 2," I'm doing what you said, guys.  Isn't that funny and what you want? "
657,0:57:25,0:57:26,SPEAKER 4, Local podcast fan dies. 
658,0:57:28,0:57:30,SPEAKER 3," The Patreon saves forever, though. "
659,0:57:30,0:57:31,SPEAKER 2, Wasn't going to save a lot of our gondars. 
660,0:57:31,0:57:32,SPEAKER 1, You piece of shit. 
661,0:57:32,0:57:33,SPEAKER 3," How about I tell you about airplane, man? "
662,0:57:33,0:57:35,SPEAKER 2," Tell me about airplane man question, Mark. "
663,0:57:35,0:57:40,SPEAKER 3," So, okay, we're flying two really quick. "
664,0:57:40,0:57:45,SPEAKER 2, I didn't know Carl Jacobs was not Carl Jobst  for like way too long. 
665,0:57:45,0:57:46,SPEAKER 4," Wait, what?  Yeah. "
666,0:57:46,0:57:47,SPEAKER 1, They're so different. 
667,0:57:47,0:57:49,SPEAKER 2, I just know I only watch Carl Jobst. 
668,0:57:49,0:57:52,SPEAKER 3, He's a man who makes commentary on speedruns. 
669,0:57:52,0:57:55,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, he does speedrun like content YouTube.  He's like a good channel. "
670,0:57:55,0:57:56,SPEAKER 4, I guess they're more alike than like they spoke. 
671,0:57:56,0:57:57,SPEAKER 2, They spoke Carl the K. 
672,0:57:57,0:58:00,SPEAKER 4, They're more like the maybe the only thing  that connects the random man. 
673,0:58:00,0:58:01,SPEAKER 3, All right. 
674,0:58:02,0:58:06,SPEAKER 2," Anyway, I got canceled on the yard. "
675,0:58:06,0:58:16,SPEAKER 3," I flew two in fro Dallas, Texas  because I surprised QD's family with like a tickets  to go see the cowboys. "
676,0:58:16,0:58:17,SPEAKER 1, How much does this? 
677,0:58:17,0:58:18,SPEAKER 2, How much does those ones cost? 
678,0:58:18,0:58:19,SPEAKER 1, Never mind. 
679,0:58:19,0:58:20,SPEAKER 3," You know, don't worry about it, man. "
680,0:58:20,0:58:21,SPEAKER 1, I won't. 
681,0:58:21,0:58:22,SPEAKER 3," You know, I won't worry about it. "
682,0:58:22,0:58:24,SPEAKER 4," So listen to the last episode, I get it. "
683,0:58:24,0:58:31,SPEAKER 3," And on the way back, I had to sit in economy. "
684,0:58:31,0:58:34,SPEAKER 1," What is, come on. "
685,0:58:34,0:58:39,SPEAKER 4," Oh, and they gave me the biscoff cookies,  but when I asked for a second one,  they said we actually can't give you two. "
686,0:58:39,0:58:43,SPEAKER 2, It's not fair for you to be a rich heel  because you're still rich.  I know. 
687,0:58:43,0:58:44,SPEAKER 1, Don't embrace this. 
688,0:58:44,0:58:45,SPEAKER 2, I won't embrace this. 
689,0:58:45,0:58:46,SPEAKER 3, I'm just telling you what happened. 
690,0:58:46,0:58:47,SPEAKER 2, You were in economy. 
691,0:58:47,0:58:48,SPEAKER 3, I blew economy. 
692,0:58:48,0:58:52,SPEAKER 2, And like you had a fucking stick and bindle  and dirt on your fucking cheeks. 
693,0:58:52,0:58:59,SPEAKER 3," I asked them for a drink, and they're like,  we don't serve alcohol.  And I saw in first class they did have alcohol.  So that's fucked. "
694,0:58:59,0:59:02,SPEAKER 1," Anyway, but look guy. "
695,0:59:02,0:59:03,SPEAKER 2," And then he's like, shut up. "
696,0:59:03,0:59:09,SPEAKER 3," I'm sitting down.  It's three cuties in the window,  crying having a panic attack, taking Xanax  because she's on a plane, she's terrified. "
697,0:59:09,0:59:10,SPEAKER 2, She's like Drake. 
698,0:59:10,0:59:16,SPEAKER 3," She does take, no, Drake's a pussy.  He takes half a zan, she took a full zan. "
699,0:59:16,0:59:18,SPEAKER 2, But did she go out like a light? 
700,0:59:18,0:59:27,SPEAKER 3," She doesn't go out like a light.  She rocks and then watches TikTok.  It takes a full zan for three hours.  And Drake takes half a zan for like what?  Half a zan, 15 hours till I land? "
701,0:59:27,0:59:28,SPEAKER 4, That's a long time. 
702,0:59:28,0:59:30,SPEAKER 3, I know.  For half a zan. 
703,0:59:30,0:59:31,SPEAKER 1, Half a zan's putting in a lot of work. 
704,0:59:31,0:59:33,SPEAKER 2," If it's a bar and you don't do it a lot, "
705,0:59:33,0:59:39,SPEAKER 1," I will say that he does his sleep.  That means Drake isn't doing a lot of zan X,  which is a good thing. "
706,0:59:39,0:59:41,SPEAKER 3, Just taking it in the zan X. 
707,0:59:43,0:59:44,SPEAKER 4, Should we get into bars? 
708,0:59:46,1:00:00,SPEAKER 3," And we're sitting next to a guy who's refreshing his phone  in the upgrade list.  Refreshing, refreshing, refreshing.  Eventually, flat attendant comes over,  taps him, he goes, you're upgraded.  Put some on first.  And I knew that because I saw two seats in first  and I went, that was me. "
709,1:00:00,1:00:01,SPEAKER 1, They're open. 
710,1:00:01,1:00:21,SPEAKER 3," And so he got one of the seats.  And I'm like, fuck yeah.  I thought we'd have the whole road to ourselves.  Unbeknownst to me, there was a stand by pilot  who boarded the plane.  The pilot ends up sitting next to me  and then someone comes over.  I think for the same upgrade,  she's like, well, you know what, they upgrade in a second.  Bear in mind, there is a definitely a free seat "
711,1:00:21,1:00:23,SPEAKER 4, that's coming over his sound.  This thing's not looking good. 
712,1:00:25,1:00:28,SPEAKER 2," Hey, is she okay?  I don't think we're gonna land by the way. "
713,1:00:28,1:00:33,SPEAKER 4," He's like, he's like, oh, I'm just kidding.  Director of your looks is fine, yeah, it's not good. "
714,1:00:33,1:00:49,SPEAKER 1," Because if someone in the Discord,  I started watching clips  from this old Discovery Channel show called Mayday,  which is just explanations behind  the most horrific plane crashes of our time.  And I was like, if I linked this to cutie right now,  it would ruin her life. "
715,1:00:49,1:00:55,SPEAKER 2, Just the thumbnail.  We send her into a fucking spiral.  So don't do that. 
716,1:00:55,1:00:57,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, that's a bad idea. "
717,1:00:57,1:00:59,SPEAKER 1," I won't, I didn't do it. "
718,1:00:59,1:01:31,SPEAKER 4," Zipper 2 was telling me about like a podcast show  to do today where like they talk about like  why plane crashes happen and they did like a study  on like Korean air  and cause they like a lot of crashes in one year or something.  And she's like, the third like largest reason for it  is miscommunication between the pilot and co-pilot  and how a lot of it is like comes from  status differences  and how they potentially don't feel confident enough  to tell them something is wrong.  So they attempt to like in a roundabout way  hint that things are wrong  and this causes communication errors that crash planes.  And I was like, dude, you can never know this. "
719,1:01:31,1:01:32,SPEAKER 2," Dude, that's so cool. "
720,1:01:32,1:01:36,SPEAKER 4, You can never know that sometimes  talkie time goes wrong and we die. 
721,1:01:36,1:01:38,SPEAKER 3, That's the root of all of our problems. 
722,1:01:38,1:01:43,SPEAKER 1, You know what we'll fix this for now?  Linkin heard the graph that shows it's the safest form  of transport.  That'll tie her over. 
723,1:01:43,1:01:45,SPEAKER 3, Miscommunication caused part of harbor. 
724,1:01:45,1:01:52,SPEAKER 2," Dude, imagine a co-pilot being like,  hey, um, Mr. Pilot, I think that the engine's failing. "
725,1:01:54,1:01:56,SPEAKER 1, So he sat down in this row with you guys. 
726,1:01:56,1:02:11,SPEAKER 3," He sat down in this row with me  and then they're like talking about an upgrade  that come back right before the flight takes off  and they're like say something to him  and he like motions to get up.  And I came here the full conversation  but basically the flight attendant jubates him.  And he's like, oh no, we didn't actually have an upgrade "
727,1:02:11,1:02:12,SPEAKER 1, for you. 
728,1:02:12,1:02:23,SPEAKER 3," I then piece together because he turns  and I see the right side of his mask.  It says spirit.  And he's a pilot for spirit airlines.  And we're on American and I'm like,  they looked down on him. "
729,1:02:23,1:02:24,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
730,1:02:24,1:02:32,SPEAKER 3, Because they could have easily upgraded this guy to first.  They upgraded some Joe Schmo instead of a pilot  which I feel like normally they do they get first to. 
731,1:02:32,1:02:33,SPEAKER 4, More of a pilot. 
732,1:02:33,1:02:37,SPEAKER 2," If you're associated with spirit,  you're a fucking, you're a tarantula. "
733,1:02:37,1:02:44,SPEAKER 3, And you know what the guy did for the entire three  to have our flight.  He looked at videos of planes.  He downloaded on YouTube. 
734,1:02:44,1:02:45,SPEAKER 1, That's so sick. 
735,1:02:45,1:02:47,SPEAKER 2," The whole time, that's like deeper. "
736,1:02:47,1:02:59,SPEAKER 3," It was like bossing to Paris in five hours  and he was like watching it.  And then he actually whipped out his calculator app  to be like, let's see how long this would have been.  The whole entire flight, I kept peeking over. "
737,1:02:59,1:02:59,SPEAKER 1, That's so sick. 
738,1:02:59,1:03:01,SPEAKER 4," And you're like, what's up man?  How are you, he's like playing. "
739,1:03:01,1:03:03,SPEAKER 1," He's just, he's a man of the craft. "
740,1:03:03,1:03:08,SPEAKER 3, And I was wondering why he was spirit  but the only time he paused was to watch the office  on the base. 
741,1:03:08,1:03:10,SPEAKER 4," Oh my God, new guy just dropped. "
742,1:03:10,1:03:14,SPEAKER 2," Dude, I would love that guy to fly me around.  I feel safe in his hands. "
743,1:03:14,1:03:20,SPEAKER 1," That guy, that guy has, he just has the best six  out of 10 hinge up hinge profile. "
744,1:03:20,1:03:21,SPEAKER 2," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. "
745,1:03:21,1:03:23,SPEAKER 4," He said, yeah, he's the pro file. "
746,1:03:23,1:03:24,SPEAKER 1, He's a pro file. 
747,1:03:24,1:03:27,SPEAKER 2," I'm sorry, I will say, if you're pilot  on a fucking dating app, that's probably goes. "
748,1:03:27,1:03:29,SPEAKER 3," Given six out of 10 handies, I'd fuck. "
749,1:03:29,1:03:33,SPEAKER 1, I love traveling.  Hey. 
750,1:03:33,1:03:42,SPEAKER 2," You know, when Dover video taught me that spirits  like earlier, like airlines that are very new  have a lot newer planes, so they're safer.  Cause like they were just, "
751,1:03:42,1:03:45,SPEAKER 3," Oh yeah, cause yeah.  Oftentimes also can buy old fleets. "
752,1:03:45,1:03:47,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, but, you know, I heard every plane "
753,1:03:47,1:03:49,SPEAKER 4, has a one in 10 chance of exploding. 
754,1:03:49,1:03:50,SPEAKER 1, That's it. 
755,1:03:52,1:03:56,SPEAKER 2," We go down, she's just like fucking squid gay man. "
756,1:03:56,1:03:59,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, she was losing it and then she zanned out after. "
757,1:03:59,1:04:01,SPEAKER 2," So, so this is, this is what happened.  There was just a spirit guy and he got. "
758,1:04:01,1:04:06,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, he got, he got, he got cucked out of first  and they could have given it to him.  And I think it's cause he's spirit. "
759,1:04:06,1:04:07,SPEAKER 1, Wow. 
760,1:04:07,1:04:10,SPEAKER 3," And he looked at plane videos, which reminded me of myself. "
761,1:04:10,1:04:26,SPEAKER 2," You know what I'm saying?  When we went to a two new hamster,  I downloaded videos beforehand, which is insane.  I never thought to do that,  but I've watched YouTube now content guy.  And I downloaded those Roblox videos of like exposing  Roblox for a, for like child labor.  Oh yeah.  It was really interesting.  Guys, watch it. "
762,1:04:26,1:04:26,SPEAKER 1, It's pretty cool. 
763,1:04:26,1:04:28,SPEAKER 3, Have you watched some dog content? 
764,1:04:28,1:04:33,SPEAKER 2," No, I watched mostly good content.  And the content I'm not sure about, I'd ask you  and you'll tell me if it's dog and then I won't watch it. "
765,1:04:33,1:04:35,SPEAKER 3, You're a sunny V2 viewer. 
766,1:04:35,1:04:44,SPEAKER 2," I, yeah, I watch them because I literally don't know  about a person and I'll watch like a mini doc on them  with an insanely editorialized bias.  And I'll be like, yeah, this is probably kind of why. "
767,1:04:44,1:04:46,SPEAKER 3, Did you watch this guy?  My least favorite YouTuber. 
768,1:04:46,1:04:48,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, actually, he's willing to say that, "
769,1:04:48,1:04:54,SPEAKER 1," which is crazy.  That's sunny.  Sunny V2.  He does the videos.  I was like, got pissed at me for watching a sunny V2 video. "
770,1:04:54,1:05:15,SPEAKER 3," Look, I can't speak to all his content,  but he releases videos almost like,  I would say most of his content now is like,  why this person is washed up?  Why this streamer's dead now?  I don't like that.  Why this YouTuber's channel died.  And it's kind of like a little info doc on like,  Epic Meal Time used to be the talk of the town.  Now it's a ghost town. "
771,1:05:15,1:05:28,SPEAKER 2," They don't use metathelias.  Like this is why, some of it's like fine journalism.  And some of it's just like, he didn't want to keep  sorry, it was later like,  and then came started this.  And then it goes to a clip of Keemstar in a podcast  saying that it's like his only source. "
772,1:05:28,1:05:32,SPEAKER 4," They remind me of the, where are they now, guy?  Yeah, it's, I hate that guy. "
773,1:05:32,1:05:35,SPEAKER 2," I mean, it's just like a real good time. "
774,1:05:35,1:05:40,SPEAKER 1," We were pissed at the same video, right?  Cause I watched the Epic Meal Time one  and I thought that was kind of interesting. "
775,1:05:40,1:05:41,SPEAKER 3," Like, and again, like, "
776,1:05:41,1:05:48,SPEAKER 1," which Epic Meal Time is the top comment on that video  and it says, Hey, this is pretty accurate, great video.  So that one seems kind of solid. "
777,1:05:48,1:05:52,SPEAKER 4, He just says bacon strips and bacon strips and bacon strips. 
778,1:05:52,1:06:02,SPEAKER 1," But please,  please, the video that I didn't like was the one  he made on Ninja, where he's just like,  he's just really mean to ninja in the whole video. "
779,1:06:02,1:06:05,SPEAKER 2," He's like, no, cause no one likes you fucking cringe ass. "
780,1:06:05,1:06:28,SPEAKER 1," Like, yeah, no, it's kind of,  it is kind of like that.  And all the, I liked that all the comments pushed back.  Cause everybody was like, Hey, man, everybody knew  that he wasn't going to be the biggest guy forever.  He made his money and maximize it where he could  and he said he was going to do that.  It's like, and you're just calling him a piece of shit  for no reason.  Like, it's clearly a fucking hit piece. "
781,1:06:28,1:06:36,SPEAKER 3," All these guys have enough like social cloud as well.  Still even ninja to the point where like,  you can release a video called wide ninja fell off  and it gets millions of views. "
782,1:06:36,1:06:36,SPEAKER 2, That's why I clicked. 
783,1:06:36,1:06:40,SPEAKER 3, I'm a clickbait boy because you know ninja in like ninja. 
784,1:06:40,1:06:42,SPEAKER 2, And then he isn't the same and then I'll click it. 
785,1:06:42,1:07:09,SPEAKER 1," The next video, the next video I watched by him  that I was super curious about,  even though I didn't like the ninja video  cause I was like, I don't want to watch this guy's video  as anymore, but then they gave me one.  It was the one about Tanacon.  And I've been, I wanted to watch this  because every time we talk about the Ludwig event,  people cite Tanacon as something to not be like.  So I wanted to know what went down  so that we could at least be a little better than that. "
786,1:07:09,1:07:16,SPEAKER 3," You can't make a good video.  I'm just saying he must sit in his room  and then just look at people who are doing slightly bad  and then be like, should I? "
787,1:07:16,1:07:30,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, it seems like he's rubbing his hands together.  It's also like, I think to be fair,  it's not an insanely, I'm not gonna click one that says,  this guy's bouncing back, right?  It's much more spicy to be like the fall of someone. "
788,1:07:30,1:07:45,SPEAKER 1," It is.  That's the good thing.  There's those, I mean, they get flacked too,  but there's like this upcomer or like score eSports videos  where they, they're like the rise and fall.  Or like the rise fall and rise again or whatever.  Like covering, which is a crazy title, by the way. "
789,1:07:45,1:07:46,SPEAKER 4, They have the rise fall rise again. 
790,1:07:46,1:07:48,SPEAKER 1, The rise fall rise. 
791,1:07:48,1:07:48,SPEAKER 4, The fall time. 
792,1:07:48,1:08:01,SPEAKER 1," He fell a little bit then.  And then the rise again.  And then it was a bit of a trough.  It was like a little lighter.  But anyway, those videos are cool when people,  like if you can provide the narrative  for like why the comeback is important. "
793,1:08:01,1:08:10,SPEAKER 2," You know, I found out when I was watching those,  because I watch one on Ricegum.  Because it literally do not know who Ricegum is  besides being mentioned, right?  By in Ludwig a couple of times. "
794,1:08:10,1:08:11,SPEAKER 1, You never watched the content cop? 
795,1:08:11,1:08:18,SPEAKER 2," Never.  And so I watched this and I was like, dude,  Ludwig talks just like Ricegum.  And you didn't reply to that when I told you that. "
796,1:08:18,1:08:21,SPEAKER 3," Well, you messaged me that.  I don't think that's true.  And I read it and I was like, I'm gonna ignore this. "
797,1:08:21,1:08:23,SPEAKER 1, I don't think that's true. 
798,1:08:23,1:08:31,SPEAKER 2," It's just like, because we go to clips of his old videos  and he's like talking to the camera  and I'm like, this is so much closer to Ludwig than not.  Except like the Ludwig YouTube would. "
799,1:08:31,1:08:32,SPEAKER 1, You are. 
800,1:08:32,1:08:33,SPEAKER 2, Am I crazy? 
801,1:08:33,1:08:35,SPEAKER 1, Decent human being. 
802,1:08:35,1:08:36,SPEAKER 2, Am I crazy? 
803,1:08:36,1:08:39,SPEAKER 1, Am I like that about you?  Am I crazy?  Yeah. 
804,1:08:39,1:08:40,SPEAKER 3, I'm it. 
805,1:08:40,1:08:44,SPEAKER 1," You're crazy.  You're crazy.  I'll say, you're crazy.  He's a bad day. "
806,1:08:44,1:08:45,SPEAKER 2, It's a nice. 
807,1:08:45,1:08:49,SPEAKER 3," Every pod, there's a point where you can time stamp it  and this is where slime was supposed to be. "
808,1:08:49,1:08:59,SPEAKER 1," Maybe, maybe, you know what?  Maybe I'm forming to solve an opposition here  because I just hate that guy so much  and I just don't want you to be like him.  Ricegum? "
809,1:08:59,1:09:03,SPEAKER 3," Yeah.  Yeah, that might be the case.  I could talk on him.  Oh, and I don't care to look it up. "
810,1:09:03,1:09:08,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, I don't know.  So yeah, that was, we watched content in this house. "
811,1:09:08,1:09:09,SPEAKER 3," Dude, shut the fuck up. "
812,1:09:09,1:09:14,SPEAKER 4," I was going, what's that?  We talked about like two pods ago  or something that the curses got. "
813,1:09:14,1:09:14,SPEAKER 1, Curse is good. 
814,1:09:14,1:09:15,SPEAKER 4, Curse is good. 
815,1:09:15,1:09:16,SPEAKER 3, Curse is good. 
816,1:09:16,1:09:18,SPEAKER 2, This is why you shouldn't drink milk. 
817,1:09:18,1:09:19,SPEAKER 1, That's his best. 
818,1:09:19,1:09:20,SPEAKER 4, I just went through one of his videos. 
819,1:09:20,1:09:21,SPEAKER 2, They're pretty good on him. 
820,1:09:21,1:09:23,SPEAKER 4," I was just like, fuck, mate, he's just sick. "
821,1:09:23,1:09:41,SPEAKER 2," They're a little apocalyptic.  That's why I don't like it.  It's a little bit like science is so right always  and you are nothing  and it makes me feel bad.  Other than that though, it's like pretty good content.  I have a thing on there.  It says ma, sopranos.  And because I thought it was funny  because I've talked about this with Mike,  because Mike like went through a soprano's binge  and just watched a whole goddamn show.  I don't know if you have seen it. "
822,1:09:41,1:09:42,SPEAKER 4, I haven't seen this pronos. 
823,1:09:42,1:10:02,SPEAKER 2," It's great.  But it's like, it's a lot.  It's a lot of fucking episodes like an hour long.  But I watched it when I was like a teenager  when it was airing  and I would download the episodes of Torrent Them.  And then I, it was like me being like,  I started calling my mom Ma  because I wanted to be cool Ma, like me soprano. "
824,1:10:02,1:10:04,SPEAKER 4, I can't believe you're doing this. 
825,1:10:04,1:10:23,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, it's really embarrassing.  But I thought it was funny because like,  my question to you guys share with me  is have you guys done that before?  Like you watch something as a younger person  and then you start like acting like it  because you think it's cool,  but it's like cringe looking back.  Oh man.  And she'd be like, why are you talking like that?  And I'm like, fuck, it's not working.  I'm not Italian. "
826,1:10:23,1:10:31,SPEAKER 1," I was one of those Peppa Pig kids  who just I had a stiller British accent  for all of my childhood  because I watched so much Peppa Pig.  Really?  No, I made that up. "
827,1:10:31,1:10:34,SPEAKER 4," But that was a crazy, I would believe. "
828,1:10:34,1:10:35,SPEAKER 1, Close enough to believe. 
829,1:10:35,1:10:43,SPEAKER 3," And it's recently enough is, I don't even know who it's from.  But some guy who says like, oh, I says to him. "
830,1:10:43,1:10:44,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, I hate that. "
831,1:10:44,1:10:47,SPEAKER 3," I don't know where it's from,  but it's from something that I watch  and I was like, oh, I like it. "
832,1:10:47,1:10:49,SPEAKER 4, I think you do it to be cool though. 
833,1:10:49,1:10:51,SPEAKER 3, I do it because I like when the guy did it.  So I do it. 
834,1:10:51,1:10:52,SPEAKER 2, The same reason. 
835,1:10:52,1:10:53,SPEAKER 1, I assess this. 
836,1:10:53,1:10:58,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, I was going to say you eat ramen like this  with the bowl on your head. "
837,1:10:58,1:10:59,SPEAKER 3, Like an antibiotic character. 
838,1:10:59,1:11:00,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, you should see him. "
839,1:11:00,1:11:06,SPEAKER 3," I slurp it up.  And then I say, it's a sign of respect in Japan.  Don't rub the chopsticks together. "
840,1:11:06,1:11:09,SPEAKER 4," I've surely done this as a kid,  but I can't remember an example. "
841,1:11:09,1:11:24,SPEAKER 1," But I know for a fact, I feel like there must be something  that I co-opted at some point.  I remember, I remember there was something  from this, there's this Canadian kid's cartoon  called the Jacob Tutu.  And I remember thing.  Yeah, I know. "
842,1:11:24,1:11:25,SPEAKER 2," Okay, you know what? "
843,1:11:25,1:11:26,SPEAKER 1, This is your space. 
844,1:11:26,1:11:28,SPEAKER 4, I'm trying over there. 
845,1:11:28,1:11:41,SPEAKER 1," And I remember some stuff from that  that stuck with me for a while.  And then I don't know if this really counts,  but you know, how you'd be at school  and people would just rip SpongeBob quotes all the time. "
846,1:11:41,1:11:42,SPEAKER 2," Ah, I'm ready. "
847,1:11:42,1:11:46,SPEAKER 3," That is, I'm going to say it, the worst quote. "
848,1:11:46,1:11:49,SPEAKER 1," You could have bought it.  Yeah, like that one.  Like that one. "
849,1:11:49,1:11:51,SPEAKER 4," Everybody would be in the watch line and say, "
850,1:11:51,1:11:52,SPEAKER 1, I'm ready. 
851,1:11:52,1:11:54,SPEAKER 4, And then look at what your friends like from SpongeBob. 
852,1:11:54,1:11:58,SPEAKER 1," Like some, like Borat. "
853,1:11:58,1:12:01,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, that's Ninja's stream. "
854,1:12:01,1:12:02,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
855,1:12:02,1:12:08,SPEAKER 3," Ninja will say some shit, but he'd do  like an oppression of Patrick or SpongeBob  or whoever.  And that's like a, "
856,1:12:08,1:12:20,SPEAKER 2," Ninja definitely has like Christian like youth group  leader energy, which is not far off from like the truth,  right?  No, it's just like he's like, yeah,  I'm a little goofy, a little zany. "
857,1:12:20,1:12:21,SPEAKER 4, He'd be your camp counselor. 
858,1:12:21,1:12:29,SPEAKER 1," There's definitely, there's definitely a camp counselor  who's exactly like him and then reaches his breaking point  and does the whole listen, listen here,  you little shit. "
859,1:12:29,1:12:30,SPEAKER 2," Oh, yeah. "
860,1:12:30,1:12:30,SPEAKER 1, Clear. 
861,1:12:30,1:12:39,SPEAKER 3, Kill most people.  I think pull from what they watch to an extent.  Like little things like even people who watch the art  a lot or my stream will pull things from that. 
862,1:12:39,1:12:40,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
863,1:12:40,1:12:46,SPEAKER 3," You know, there are people walking around who watch  a truck, a little truck, I was going,  cricky crunch miss, which like that exists in the universe. "
864,1:12:46,1:12:48,SPEAKER 2, Get hell back.  We don't want you in the world. 
865,1:12:48,1:12:54,SPEAKER 3," What I hate is the amount of people whose personality  is just quote in TikToks.  Yeah, Bing Bong. "
866,1:12:54,1:13:02,SPEAKER 4," Oh, dude, dude, people who are their whole form of communication  is just saying TikToks back to each other. "
867,1:13:02,1:13:03,SPEAKER 3, Do you like that in ballerines sometimes? 
868,1:13:03,1:13:06,SPEAKER 2," Okay, Brad says over here.  Okay, go back to them. "
869,1:13:06,1:13:09,SPEAKER 1," That's crazy, because Bing Bong didn't even start on TikTok, "
870,1:13:09,1:13:11,SPEAKER 3, right?  I believe it was a YouTube video. 
871,1:13:11,1:13:13,SPEAKER 1, It was post it on.  Side talk NYC. 
872,1:13:13,1:13:14,SPEAKER 3, Yeah. 
873,1:13:14,1:13:27,SPEAKER 1," And then also people just think it's so weird,  because it's like people, it's just morphed into saying  Bing Bong for no reason, but the reason they say that  is because it's the intro to all of his videos.  It's like what?  It's like a friend of the channel. "
874,1:13:27,1:13:32,SPEAKER 3, The left says Bing Bong in the right says Brad in. 
875,1:13:32,1:13:34,SPEAKER 1, It's like one of the sounds in the subway or something. 
876,1:13:34,1:13:36,SPEAKER 2, A call sign for the ages. 
877,1:13:36,1:13:41,SPEAKER 1, Joe or like fucking just yelling like Joe Byron. 
878,1:13:41,1:13:54,SPEAKER 2," Here's the thing, we as humans need to feel connected  and it doesn't matter.  We used to think it was God, but it's not.  Like Don De Lillo said, it could be Toyota Celica.  And that could be something we connect with  and it doesn't fucking matter.  That's why we don't know. "
879,1:13:54,1:13:56,SPEAKER 3, What's the connection thing if you watch the yard? 
880,1:13:56,1:13:58,SPEAKER 2, The yard were the same. 
881,1:13:58,1:14:00,SPEAKER 3, People love that.  You want that to be it? 
882,1:14:00,1:14:01,SPEAKER 2," No, I don't want it.  It just is. "
883,1:14:01,1:14:08,SPEAKER 4, People tell me that.  We are the same as I've had so many people say they have taken  that bit and they have put it in their friend group. 
884,1:14:08,1:14:09,SPEAKER 1, That's okay. 
885,1:14:09,1:14:19,SPEAKER 2," We used to get kind of upset.  We were like, the bad melee podcast was where we would bring  bits that we were ready to kill.  Yeah.  And now it's just like, you know what, it's okay. "
886,1:14:19,1:14:23,SPEAKER 3, Bad melee is where you bit off Arizona bits. 
887,1:14:23,1:14:24,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, 100% than random. "
888,1:14:24,1:14:25,SPEAKER 2, I didn't know. 
889,1:14:25,1:14:28,SPEAKER 1," We're just biting off Australian bits.  No, we didn't know. "
890,1:14:28,1:14:29,SPEAKER 2, No. 
891,1:14:29,1:14:30,SPEAKER 4, She actually didn't know them. 
892,1:14:30,1:14:32,SPEAKER 2, I didn't know that we were biting AZ bits 
893,1:14:32,1:14:35,SPEAKER 1, until way later.  This is before me.  I would've told more. 
894,1:14:35,1:14:36,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, well we. "
895,1:14:36,1:14:37,SPEAKER 3, I was part of it. 
896,1:14:37,1:14:39,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
897,1:14:39,1:14:41,SPEAKER 3," If I let them run a train on me, I deserve it. "
898,1:14:41,1:14:46,SPEAKER 4," No, I heard them bite one, I don't know which one.  I heard them bite one of our bits and I was like, yes. "
899,1:14:46,1:14:48,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, finally.  Finally, give back. "
900,1:14:48,1:14:50,SPEAKER 4," Hey, fair trade.  Thank you. "
901,1:14:50,1:14:51,SPEAKER 1, It was one to one. 
902,1:14:51,1:14:52,SPEAKER 3, It was one to one. 
903,1:14:52,1:15:00,SPEAKER 4," Really?  We had it from douchebag Dylan.  He pretty much invents every bit and then we, like it goes through the pipeline  and we take it and we drink sausages. "
904,1:15:00,1:15:05,SPEAKER 2," Peppus riders.  What happened, Ludwig?  Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo. "
905,1:15:05,1:15:07,SPEAKER 3," Tell me about Kingdom Hearts, man. "
906,1:15:07,1:15:18,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, I've been, dude, I'll send you a picture zipper.  I've been grinding Kingdom Hearts final mix, right?  Because it's like you can buy the game with all of them. "
907,1:15:18,1:15:20,SPEAKER 1," Yeah.  Is that one, two, and three? "
908,1:15:20,1:15:25,SPEAKER 2," It's one, two.  It's one, two.  Chain of memories, which is a remake of a Game Boy Advance game in 3D. "
909,1:15:25,1:15:26,SPEAKER 1, The remake is crazy. 
910,1:15:26,1:15:27,SPEAKER 3, The remake is good. 
911,1:15:27,1:15:34,SPEAKER 2," I played the Game Boy Advance game.  That's how fuck it.  I played all these fucking games.  I did too.  And then it also comes with birth by sleep, the PSP game, which is also pretty good. "
912,1:15:34,1:15:35,SPEAKER 1, Good game. 
913,1:15:35,1:15:36,SPEAKER 2, And it's crazy. 
914,1:15:36,1:15:38,SPEAKER 3," And it's like damn, this is a good game.  And it plays well on the, on the PlayStation. "
915,1:15:38,1:15:55,SPEAKER 2," The value here is crazy and I, so right now I've just been playing through it and Ludwig  came home of, when they came back from New Hampshire and my door's open and just hearing  like, freeze, goofy, deep freeze, wrinkle, and he's just like, like Kingdom Hearts, like "
916,1:15:55,1:15:56,SPEAKER 1, my dad. 
917,1:15:56,1:16:17,SPEAKER 2," Yeah.  And I'm like, yeah.  And I just dude, I've been putting like 10, 12 hours session, just grinding.  But now I'm at endgame and I really want the ultimate weapon and I want to beat Sephiroth.  So I sent this to you zipper.  This is my setup.  So I lay on my carpet right there.  And I grind Kingdom Hearts to grind mats to get the ultimate weapon because it takes a while  and then watch movies. "
918,1:16:17,1:16:18,SPEAKER 1, Holy shit. 
919,1:16:18,1:16:40,SPEAKER 2," And so I'm like deep in it.  And then I asked Ludwig, so if you guys don't know, our friend Zeke, who made a funny  little clip of us talking about him, we were tweeted it.  But he came to LA and he needed place to stay so he said it Ludwig's old studio apartment.  And he was there for like a week, right?  Yeah.  And you guys just played Kingdom Hearts together.  Yeah.  And every day you would come home for work and play Kingdom Hearts together. "
920,1:16:40,1:16:41,SPEAKER 4, I had this experience with Ludwig too. 
921,1:16:41,1:16:42,SPEAKER 3, We 100% of the game. 
922,1:16:42,1:16:46,SPEAKER 2," So, but I asked Ludwig, I was like, you guys do it on proud mode? "
923,1:16:46,1:16:46,SPEAKER 1," And I was like, yeah. "
924,1:16:46,1:16:48,SPEAKER 2, And then I asked Zeke later on. 
925,1:16:48,1:16:50,SPEAKER 1," I was like, you guys do it on proud mode? "
926,1:16:50,1:16:58,SPEAKER 2," He was like, absolutely not.  We are pussies.  And I went to Ludwig and I was like, you didn't do it on proud mode?  He's like, I beat Jump King. "
927,1:16:58,1:16:59,SPEAKER 1, Fuck you. 
928,1:16:59,1:17:01,SPEAKER 4, That's actually the Ludwig. 
929,1:17:01,1:17:02,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
930,1:17:02,1:17:03,SPEAKER 4, You're just finding another entity. 
931,1:17:03,1:17:04,SPEAKER 1, I beat Pogo so too. 
932,1:17:04,1:17:07,SPEAKER 2," Don't talk to me.  And I was like, he's right.  But you didn't do what I'm doing. "
933,1:17:07,1:17:10,SPEAKER 3, I did beat all three Jump Kings in less than 45 minutes and you can't touch me. 
934,1:17:10,1:17:16,SPEAKER 2," I did see you grind in that was hype.  Anyway, yeah.  I've been grinding and it's on proud mode and it's really hard.  And it's nice to just play video games. "
935,1:17:16,1:17:17,SPEAKER 1, I don't know. 
936,1:17:17,1:17:18,SPEAKER 2, Yeah. 
937,1:17:18,1:17:21,SPEAKER 3, I'm a degenerate now.  It's so funny that you're playing Kingdom Hearts 1 again. 
938,1:17:21,1:17:22,SPEAKER 2, I haven't played it since I was a kid. 
939,1:17:22,1:17:23,SPEAKER 3, I haven't played it since I was a kid. 
940,1:17:23,1:17:26,SPEAKER 2, I haven't played it since I was a kid.  I haven't played it since I was a kid.  I haven't played it since I was a kid. 
941,1:17:26,1:17:27,SPEAKER 3," No, because I want to play them all and then play Kimiart III. "
942,1:17:27,1:17:28,SPEAKER 1, You're going to be so sad. 
943,1:17:28,1:17:30,SPEAKER 2," You're like me reading Doon.  Yeah, I'm like that. "
944,1:17:30,1:17:33,SPEAKER 1," Before I watch the movie.  That's, yeah.  It's the same thing with me. "
945,1:17:33,1:17:36,SPEAKER 2," It's the same again.  Again, here we are.  Two of the same guys. "
946,1:17:36,1:17:38,SPEAKER 1, And you have to say it.  You have to agree now. 
947,1:17:38,1:17:46,SPEAKER 2," I agree with you because we're the same.  Dude, by the way, remember in the episode with your beautiful mother that we were talking  about the trivia. "
948,1:17:46,1:17:47,SPEAKER 3, The trivia. 
949,1:17:47,1:17:48,SPEAKER 2, Talking about the trivia. 
950,1:17:48,1:17:49,SPEAKER 1, It's got a bit of a two. 
951,1:17:49,1:18:08,SPEAKER 2," Someone came up with a good, if we ever have a trivia battle or something where we get  mad at each other about opinions, someone had a good fucking reward for that, which is  whoever wins.  Anytime there's an argument, someone else has to say shut up pussy boy and they have  to shut up and they have to agree.  Oh wow.  And I like that a lot.  Yeah. "
952,1:18:08,1:18:09,SPEAKER 3, Because then you can just stomp it out. 
953,1:18:09,1:18:10,SPEAKER 2, For ever? 
954,1:18:10,1:18:11,SPEAKER 4, Maybe like a year. 
955,1:18:11,1:18:12,SPEAKER 1, Until the next argument. 
956,1:18:12,1:18:15,SPEAKER 3, Hmm.  I would say you get like 10 times. 
957,1:18:15,1:18:19,SPEAKER 2," No, I think it's good for like a year and it's only about like movies, media, whatever, "
958,1:18:19,1:18:20,SPEAKER 1, right? 
959,1:18:20,1:18:21,SPEAKER 3, I would like deeper things. 
960,1:18:21,1:18:24,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, I would hate if this was, imagine this applies to like business meetings. "
961,1:18:24,1:18:26,SPEAKER 4," Dude, you had sex with my shut up pussy boy. "
962,1:18:26,1:18:28,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.  Dude. 
963,1:18:28,1:18:30,SPEAKER 2, So I think that's a good idea if you want to get up. 
964,1:18:30,1:18:31,SPEAKER 3, It's not a bad idea. 
965,1:18:31,1:18:32,SPEAKER 2, Ball rolling on that. 
966,1:18:32,1:18:36,SPEAKER 3," Yeah.  Hey, look, we got to get the ball rolling on the tattoo contest.  What's up with that? "
967,1:18:36,1:18:39,SPEAKER 1," Yeah.  Oh, the brackets made.  We're ready to go. "
968,1:18:39,1:18:41,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, we're ready to go.  This is Kingdom Hearts. "
969,1:18:41,1:18:47,SPEAKER 1, This is Kingdom Hearts.  We're going to do it this week.  We were going to do January 6th.  We blocked that in.  Well. 
970,1:18:47,1:18:48,SPEAKER 3," Tell you what, after the right now. "
971,1:18:48,1:18:49,SPEAKER 2, We're going to go to Washington. 
972,1:18:49,1:18:50,SPEAKER 1, We're going to figure it out. 
973,1:18:50,1:18:51,SPEAKER 3, So don't fret. 
974,1:18:51,1:18:55,SPEAKER 2, What?  Nick being in COVID was.  Are you actually going to Washington?  Of course not. 
975,1:18:55,1:18:56,SPEAKER 1, I believe you too. 
976,1:18:56,1:18:58,SPEAKER 3," January 6th, do you not get it? "
977,1:18:58,1:19:00,SPEAKER 4," Oh, I thought you meant the state. "
978,1:19:00,1:19:02,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, because you would. "
979,1:19:02,1:19:05,SPEAKER 1," But me, we are talking.  I thought he said that, too. "
980,1:19:05,1:19:07,SPEAKER 4," I didn't get it, but I got what he was saying now. "
981,1:19:07,1:19:14,SPEAKER 2," That's why people say, I'm not going to see it.  And we should go to the Capitol and do something about it.  She's this fuck.  That is fucking right. "
982,1:19:14,1:19:20,SPEAKER 1," The podcast makes too much money to get it out.  Yardigan's, it's time we take our country. "
983,1:19:20,1:19:21,SPEAKER 2, Yeah. 
984,1:19:21,1:19:23,SPEAKER 3, Yeah.  Yeah. 
985,1:19:23,1:19:27,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.  Yeah.  I call them Yardigan. 
986,1:19:27,1:19:28,SPEAKER 3, Stand back. 
987,1:19:28,1:19:29,SPEAKER 1, Stand by. 
988,1:19:29,1:19:33,SPEAKER 2, They showed with signs that says Biden.  We are not the same.

990,1:19:35,1:19:38,SPEAKER 3," What day, January 6th?  You want to do that?  I'll rock it. "

1017,1:21:13,1:21:16,SPEAKER 2," Because people are like, yeah, I feel bad. I can't fucking do it. "
1018,1:21:16,1:21:27,SPEAKER 4, I would love it if I could go on lime wire and it's like the yard entire Patreon collection.  Download it. It's just soldier boy cranked that. That would be so sick. 
1019,1:21:28,1:21:37,SPEAKER 2," We also are coming out with an item that I'm putting together. I think it's really going to be  fucking sick. I don't want to fucking spoil it. I wouldn't spoil it. But it's very, very sick. "
1020,1:21:37,1:21:41,SPEAKER 4, I know this item. It's very sick. I'm down to like it. It's a t-shirt. 
1021,1:21:41,1:21:50,SPEAKER 3," Hey, not a shirt. You know, it's crazy. By the way, real quick. So I did a stream with  this Vtuber named Iron Mouse. I'll have to become a Vtuber because I lost our contest. "
1022,1:21:50,1:22:08,SPEAKER 2," I saw that. Can you become like a big dick and a ball?  Like just a giant talking dick. Yeah, there's a guy. Shindags, I think on Twitter, really,  really funny. He made my esports dream like simulator. Yeah, yeah. And he makes shindags. Yeah,  shindags makes really funny Vtuber like avatars. He made one that's a gun. "
1023,1:22:09,1:22:34,SPEAKER 3," So that talks. Yeah, it's really should hit him. Let's get connected. Yeah. That sounds like  Hey, like yeah, great. I bring it up only as a small quip. But someone was like,  Hey, I made this song. Iron Mouse finally finished. It took me so long. And the song title,  I shit you not, is dance with the devil. And nobody in the comments said anything.  And I didn't want to be the guy. You don't be all. This is the most fucked up song. "
1024,1:22:34,1:22:39,SPEAKER 4," But most important song you'll ever listen to. I was like, we got to have a moral "
1025,1:22:39,1:22:43,SPEAKER 3," technique. You got to rethink that because when people look for it on YouTube, they're gonna hit it. "
1026,1:22:43,1:22:54,SPEAKER 4," Did you see my reply to the Logan tweet? Yes. So that for some backstory,  a smasher named Logan's tweet has since been deleted, but made a tier list of the "
1027,1:22:54,1:23:07,SPEAKER 3," different religious scripts. It was big enough that it hit my timeline. I don't follow him.  And I'm not like most people I follow aren't smash. Yeah, but it hit mine because so many people  were like, quote, retweeting it or replying. It was it was it was pretty bad. It was pretty "
1028,1:23:07,1:23:23,SPEAKER 2," custom because because because one of the tiers was like dog water. And it was like a Judaism.  And it's like, don't do that. Right. You're gonna. It was it was supposed to be based off them  reading the text and like, it was supposed to be my favorite. The thoughtlessism is an "
1029,1:23:23,1:23:35,SPEAKER 3," owl. It was a good points, but like American Catholicism is an L. Yeah, that was one of the  tier names. They reduced all shintoism to like interesting AF. So Logan drops an incredibly "
1030,1:23:35,1:24:15,SPEAKER 4," based tweet. And we're and we're in the discord call. It's me and Mike a few others. And we're  talking about how insane this is. And we're immediately like we could we could workshop the  perfect reply to this tweet. We're all together high of minding. Was it the wise, the  most man one? No, it's a reply. The redo was my one was where he was like, we were talking  about like, what could we I was like the start off like we just add cane to the list.  And that's good enough. And then Mike was like, you have to put dance with the devil  and the tier where it says like interesting AF. And we're all in this call losing our minds like  say, oh, we're about to form the perfect tweet. Yeah. I like to quote you to reply to "
1031,1:24:15,1:24:20,SPEAKER 2," these like the three wise men beating your ass and the QRTs. Yeah, yeah. I just wanted to show "
1032,1:24:20,1:24:23,SPEAKER 4, the sausage we're made for a second. We all we definitely high-minded that one. Sometimes you 
1033,1:24:23,1:24:29,SPEAKER 3," get in the call and just what's crazy is he ripped that tweet and then went to bed. Yeah, this "
1034,1:24:29,1:25:43,SPEAKER 2," happened. I got in some beef with Logan who I believe goes by they them and where I they put up  a tweet that was like commentary in a nutshell. Maybe like commentary because they're like a sick  melee player. And it was me basically saying, this is how this person is doing really good and then  they die. So it made it look. And if you're a melee commentator is not good at the game by the way,  all you do is get shit on for not being good and whatever being a cloud chaser. And so I took  this and interpreted this as damn, this person's cooking me the fuck. And so I replied very  meanly. Oh, and uh, what? I know. I don't know. Like off rip you were mean to someone. I'm lying.  I know. But it was, but it was fucked up because I felt slided because I was like I defended you  in goddamn Ludwig's chat. And I clipped it where I was like people were coming from the BTS  stream because Logan is on the couch and people like get this fucking person off the couch. And I was  like, don't and they were coming in low, uh, Ludwig's chat and be like, fuck, thank God, we got  away from that commentary. Oh, yeah, that was all day. And I was like, don't fucking come in here.  Like it's your little safe haven. You fucking be nice to people. Go fuck yourself. And I was like,  I defended you and you're shitting on me, eat my shit, etc. Yeah. And anyway, Logan was not awake "
1035,1:25:43,1:25:49,SPEAKER 4," for like the whole day. Same shit. Same shit, which is just like people wake up. It says 20 plus. "
1036,1:25:49,1:25:55,SPEAKER 1," You're like, oh, yeah. Maybe one of my combos popped up. And it was. And then I was like, oh, dude, "
1037,1:25:55,1:26:17,SPEAKER 2," like I didn't mean it that way. Like defended themselves. And I was like, wasn't that like no one  really believed that. And they're like, they've deleted the defending and I was like, yo, I'm sorry.  Like I get how this was misinterpreting. And it just happened again where it's like bad faith  interpretation. And then not sleep, not waking up for 15 hours straight in the daytime. Or whatever.  Yeah. And then just coming back to your phone and be like, oh, God. "
1038,1:26:19,1:26:23,SPEAKER 4," You know, it's like you clicked the long lock button, the Taco Bell bell goes off. "
1039,1:26:25,1:26:28,SPEAKER 3," Anyway, 20 K patrons, we drop our tier list. "
1040,1:26:28,1:26:34,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, the world religions. Yeah. And also, we rank all women. "
1041,1:26:34,1:26:50,SPEAKER 1," Also national. Every woman will rank.  Meryl Streep goat here. You hear about our D-Cob tier list.  We're watching the, we were watching the movie this week. Tiger Cruise.  And which D-Cob moms are most likely to throw it back? "
1042,1:26:51,1:26:56,SPEAKER 2," We need to get on that. The D-Moms.  The D-Moms. The D-Moms, the D-Moms tier list. "
1043,1:26:56,1:26:58,SPEAKER 3," If you don't make a D-Dad's one, you're sexist. "
1044,1:26:58,1:27:02,SPEAKER 4," 100%. Okay, which D-Dad's I want to see in the shower? "
1045,1:27:02,1:27:05,SPEAKER 1," No, which D-Dads give the best pipe? "
1046,1:27:07,1:27:10,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, that's it. Which D-Dads have that D-D. "
1047,1:27:10,1:27:11,SPEAKER 3, Now I want bored of the tier list. 
1048,1:27:11,1:27:13,SPEAKER 2," And it's just Mickey, but he's like bonding with it. "
1049,1:27:13,1:27:18,SPEAKER 1, Not the dad in this movie.  That guy's low. What'd you say? 
1050,1:27:18,1:27:20,SPEAKER 3, Zipper just pulled up a tier list. I don't know if it. 
1051,1:27:20,1:27:22,SPEAKER 2," Oh, yeah. Did he channel mom's tier list this? "
1052,1:27:22,1:27:25,SPEAKER 1, No. No. This is not what I want. The title's wrong. 
1053,1:27:25,1:27:28,SPEAKER 3," I know what's wrong. I know, but it's weird that that already. "
1054,1:27:28,1:27:29,SPEAKER 4, Because it's not weird. 
1055,1:27:30,1:27:33,SPEAKER 1, It's not about attractiveness.  It's who's most likely to throw it back. 
1056,1:27:33,1:27:36,SPEAKER 3," Okay, first of all, which is better. "
1057,1:27:36,1:27:40,SPEAKER 2," That's right.  Yeah, sorry. He's a patrician. "
1058,1:27:40,1:27:42,SPEAKER 1, We need to mess the sickest guy. 
1059,1:27:42,1:27:50,SPEAKER 2," Who has the what?  The sickest what?  Oh, the sickest guy.  Yeah, and now Aiden's a problematic one. "
1060,1:27:50,1:27:51,SPEAKER 3," You're problematic, right? "
1061,1:27:51,1:27:52,SPEAKER 2," Get him, Clippers. "
1062,1:27:52,1:27:55,SPEAKER 4," If we were trying to move away from the locker room vibe,  we've just solidified it. "
1063,1:27:56,1:27:58,SPEAKER 2, Which D-Call mom has the best mood? 
1064,1:27:59,1:28:02,SPEAKER 4," Oh, my God.  That's the first time that's been set. "

1071,1:28:24,1:28:28,SPEAKER 1," Oh, like, oh, but I was.  It's pooped. "
1072,1:28:30,1:28:43,SPEAKER 2," I was, I was asking this.  We were playing Valorant.  Brain storming because it was,  it was all of us.  We were talking about, but it just like,  every time we do, we would just say it.  And then we'd all collect and be like,  oh, but you're like, you're trying it out.  Like, you're on the school like, play around. "
1073,1:28:43,1:28:45,SPEAKER 1, I'm looking for some bad. 
1074,1:28:45,1:28:51,SPEAKER 2," Some, so my question is,  is there equivalent maybe for like,  took, okay, you're all right. "
1075,1:28:51,1:28:52,SPEAKER 1," Are you good, bro? "
1076,1:28:52,1:28:55,SPEAKER 3," He's okay. He's rocking.  Dude, you dropped your present. "
1077,1:28:55,1:28:58,SPEAKER 4," You dropped your pocket.  Oh, I liked it unfortunately. "
1078,1:28:58,1:28:59,SPEAKER 1, Watch out for that drive. 
1079,1:28:59,1:29:00,SPEAKER 2, Watch out for that drive bottle. 
1080,1:29:00,1:29:01,SPEAKER 4, Watch out for that drive bottle. 
1081,1:29:01,1:29:08,SPEAKER 2," And so I was wondering if there's like a,  a male version of mutt, which is like,  makes it feel that gross,  but you're talking about diggin' balls. "
1082,1:29:10,1:29:12,SPEAKER 1, I believe the example was some stank. 
1083,1:29:12,1:29:19,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, I was like,  oh, I'm gonna go get some stank tonight.  And then, and then sock was like,  oh, yeah, we, we say whoop. "
1084,1:29:20,1:29:23,SPEAKER 1," What?  Like a whole, like, butthole. "
1085,1:29:23,1:29:24,SPEAKER 2, And I get some whoop. 
1086,1:29:24,1:29:25,SPEAKER 4," Mine, John. "
1087,1:29:26,1:29:28,SPEAKER 2," So that's kind of, I don't know. "
1088,1:29:28,1:29:33,SPEAKER 4," At some point, so at some point,  after the e-moo war, they solved the comedy.  It was very soon after. "
1089,1:29:33,1:29:35,SPEAKER 2," Like, hey, this was pretty funny. "
1090,1:29:35,1:29:35,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, let's. "
1091,1:29:36,1:29:37,SPEAKER 2, We lost the beds. 
1092,1:29:38,1:29:40,SPEAKER 1, They did lose to the birds. 
1093,1:29:41,1:29:44,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, they just got what it takes.  Where are we by the way? "
1094,1:29:44,1:29:50,SPEAKER 3, I want to finish this up because it's been on the list for two weeks.  John Madden.  What's he doing here? 
1095,1:29:50,1:29:56,SPEAKER 1, He died.  Oh.  You actually don't know. 
1096,1:29:56,1:29:56,SPEAKER 4, He knew. 
1097,1:29:56,1:29:57,SPEAKER 1, He knew. 
1098,1:29:57,1:30:15,SPEAKER 2," Me and Ludwig, when it happened,  it was last week and we just never got to talk about it.  And I thought it was interesting because Madden is funny  because he's like, he literally has the emblematic  like series of NFL games is named after him.  Madden.  Yeah, but he's not a player.  He's just a guy. "
1099,1:30:15,1:30:16,SPEAKER 3, I think he might have been. 
1100,1:30:16,1:30:16,SPEAKER 2, No. 
1101,1:30:16,1:30:17,SPEAKER 3, He was a coach. 
1102,1:30:17,1:30:18,SPEAKER 1, Was he a coach? 
1103,1:30:18,1:30:18,SPEAKER 4, Yeah. 
1104,1:30:18,1:30:19,SPEAKER 3, He was a 100% a coach. 
1105,1:30:19,1:30:28,SPEAKER 1," Ludwig.  Ludwig, as a resident football expert.  I need you to explain.  His significance and notoriety outside of video game. "
1106,1:30:28,1:30:30,SPEAKER 3," Okay, don't ask the 26-year-old. "
1107,1:30:31,1:30:33,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, it's that predate through the oldest person on the pod. "
1108,1:30:33,1:30:36,SPEAKER 3, I could not get into football until 2011. 
1109,1:30:37,1:30:38,SPEAKER 2," Oh, Tibo? "
1110,1:30:38,1:30:41,SPEAKER 3," No, when Tom Brady threw a 99-yard touchdown pass. "
1111,1:30:41,1:30:43,SPEAKER 4, That's the last time you're using his son. 
1112,1:30:43,1:30:44,SPEAKER 1, Was that senior? 
1113,1:30:44,1:30:45,SPEAKER 2, He kisses son on the lips. 
1114,1:30:45,1:30:47,SPEAKER 4, You saw the video and you said maybe I have a chance. 
1115,1:30:47,1:30:49,SPEAKER 2, Is that where he scorched a moot from his son? 
1116,1:30:51,1:30:51,SPEAKER 1, It's called butt. 
1117,1:30:52,1:30:54,SPEAKER 4, It's called butt.  It's right. 
1118,1:30:54,1:31:18,SPEAKER 3," Anyway, John Madden.  Bit of an icon.  I will, you know what?  By the way, then this shows you how disgusting clout is.  Betty White died.  Everyone's throwing a who in a hawk  because she didn't reach a hundred.  Today, Kane Takana turned to 127.  Oldest human alive.  No one gives a fuck. "
1119,1:31:18,1:31:22,SPEAKER 2," Well, I do now.  Well, you didn't know who is he.  Did he was he on a show? "
1120,1:31:22,1:31:23,SPEAKER 3, It's a woman. 
1121,1:31:23,1:31:24,SPEAKER 2," Oh, was she on a show? "
1122,1:31:24,1:31:29,SPEAKER 3," No, she's just the oldest human literally in the world.  Here's the thing.  No, she's alive.  She just had a weapon. "
1123,1:31:29,1:31:31,SPEAKER 2," Well, maybe she should die like Betty White.  And then we'll care. "
1124,1:31:31,1:31:34,SPEAKER 3," I'm just saying, turning the oldest age. "
1125,1:31:34,1:31:34,SPEAKER 1, Anyone he is. 
1126,1:31:34,1:31:41,SPEAKER 4," But here's the thing.  I don't think people were saying around  when Betty White wasn't known to be dead.  Dude, Betty White popped a turn of a hundred.  That's crazy. "
1127,1:31:41,1:31:41,SPEAKER 1, They were. 
1128,1:31:41,1:31:43,SPEAKER 4, People were saying that before. 
1129,1:31:43,1:31:45,SPEAKER 3, She rendered on Twitter three weeks before her birthday. 
1130,1:31:45,1:31:46,SPEAKER 1, I'm straight up wrong. 
1131,1:31:46,1:31:47,SPEAKER 2, That's rough. 
1132,1:31:47,1:31:49,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, that sucks.  That isn't exactly wrong. "
1133,1:31:49,1:31:51,SPEAKER 3, She tried to push she was about a turn of a hundred  and she died. 
1134,1:31:51,1:31:52,SPEAKER 4," She's like, she's like, hey, watch this. "
1135,1:31:54,1:31:55,SPEAKER 1, These fuckers don't know what's calling it. 
1136,1:31:55,1:31:56,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, no idea. "
1137,1:31:56,1:31:57,SPEAKER 2, Just slips a cow with stocky. 
1138,1:31:58,1:32:06,SPEAKER 1," Anyway, yeah, that is that is, you know, maybe maybe because  that person was already the oldest human a lot.  She is. "
1139,1:32:06,1:32:12,SPEAKER 4," She just I didn't think also it's just the number, right?  It's like 128 would be the next one.  And that's not that interesting with number. "
1140,1:32:12,1:32:13,SPEAKER 3," Actually, excuse me.  She's 119. "
1141,1:32:13,1:32:15,SPEAKER 1," Oh, you don't know.  It's funny. "
1142,1:32:15,1:32:15,SPEAKER 3, I'm. 
1143,1:32:15,1:32:16,SPEAKER 4, You don't even remember the number.  I tell you. 
1144,1:32:16,1:32:18,SPEAKER 1," You need tamer name, right? "
1145,1:32:18,1:32:20,SPEAKER 3," Okay, I got the few things wrong on the story. "
1146,1:32:20,1:32:25,SPEAKER 1," You watched, you watched like one.  About one billion.  That's about Japan.  I didn't pronounce this lady's name. "
1147,1:32:25,1:32:27,SPEAKER 4," Dude, someone can foge off that and she's like, she's "
1148,1:32:27,1:32:30,SPEAKER 3," like, I think the oldest human to have ever been ever. "
1149,1:32:30,1:32:31,SPEAKER 1, I said my fucking veins. 
1150,1:32:31,1:32:33,SPEAKER 3," 22, zipper. "
1151,1:32:34,1:32:35,SPEAKER 2," Oh, we need zipper.  I was getting some. "
1152,1:32:35,1:32:37,SPEAKER 1, Getting old one today. 
1153,1:32:37,1:32:38,SPEAKER 3, It's a French woman. 
1154,1:32:38,1:32:39,SPEAKER 4, Do the shit. 
1155,1:32:39,1:32:42,SPEAKER 1," This is all wrong thing.  Oh, yeah, 122. "
1156,1:32:43,1:32:46,SPEAKER 4," Damn, they died when Aiden was born.  That kind of makes sense. "
1157,1:32:47,1:32:49,SPEAKER 1, And I will live for 122 more years. 
1158,1:32:49,1:32:53,SPEAKER 3, You carry on her legacy and combined.  You guys are 244 years of history. 
1159,1:32:53,1:32:55,SPEAKER 4, That's who Aiden was in his past life. 
1160,1:32:55,1:32:56,SPEAKER 1, It's like. 
1161,1:32:56,1:33:04,SPEAKER 2," It is crazy to have a, like,  New years past your 100.  She comes through some people have.  Yeah, you know.  It's like, I got a hundred more. "
1162,1:33:04,1:33:06,SPEAKER 4, I don't think I want to make it past 100. 
1163,1:33:06,1:33:09,SPEAKER 2, I want to be a mortal and live in space. 
1164,1:33:09,1:33:13,SPEAKER 1," That's ideal, like technique.  I want to make it do 103. "
1165,1:33:13,1:33:14,SPEAKER 2, Are you farting in your nice pants? 
1166,1:33:14,1:33:26,SPEAKER 3," Hey, well, thanks so much for watching this episode of the yard, everyone.  Again, one final reminder to maybe check out the Patreon.  If you want to vote for Nick's tattoo,  he's going to get a real tattoo on his body.  And you guys will literally just put it in his. "
1167,1:33:26,1:33:28,SPEAKER 4," I made it all just forgot.  I mean, move on.  Nah, we all just forgot. "
1168,1:33:28,1:33:32,SPEAKER 2," Also, a lot of stuff got backed up because of, like,  Nick, we're going to BTS, then Nick getting COVID. "
1169,1:33:32,1:33:35,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, I got far, December.  I got fucking old. "
1170,1:33:35,1:33:44,SPEAKER 2," So there's a bit of a latch between the,  the badges of things coming out.  But this is, you know,  we'll see what happens next.  Anyway, thanks for watching. "

1175,1:33:48,1:33:50,SPEAKER 2," Oh, wait, we got to clickbait. "
1176,1:33:50,1:33:51,SPEAKER 1," Did it beep, beep, beep, beep? "
1177,1:33:51,1:33:53,SPEAKER 3," No, they know you. "
1178,1:33:53,1:33:55,SPEAKER 2, When have you ever given up on clickbait? 
1179,1:33:55,1:33:56,SPEAKER 1, We just clickbaited the Patreon already. 
1180,1:33:56,1:33:58,SPEAKER 3," I did it subtle, like, "
1181,1:33:58,1:34:02,SPEAKER 2," no, clickbait for the bonus episode that we're going to shoot right now. "
1182,1:34:02,1:34:04,SPEAKER 3, Does it matter?  Because they're all going to go. 
1183,1:34:04,1:34:10,SPEAKER 4," So during my time with COVID,  I nutted in a jar.  Why kept it the whole time? "
1184,1:34:10,1:34:11,SPEAKER 1, Why would you do that? 
1185,1:34:11,1:34:14,SPEAKER 4, And I'll show everyone on the Patreon. 
1186,1:34:14,1:34:16,SPEAKER 1, I don't want to see that.  I don't want to do that either.
