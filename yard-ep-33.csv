2,0:00:16,0:00:20,SPEAKER 2, Can I ask you a question offer it? Do you think he's going bald? 
3,0:00:21,0:00:28,SPEAKER 3," Be honest like there's potential. Yeah, I could see you brushing it forward "
4,0:00:30,0:00:36,SPEAKER 1, Potentially this lovely head of hair. It'll wax just to keep it over. We're actually two for two really you're pretty good 
5,0:00:36,0:00:42,SPEAKER 2," Oh, I'm thick you got to think how long but the moment one hair falls in the shower  It's like fins to ride "
6,0:00:42,0:00:50,SPEAKER 4, London what do you mean has London heritage not not London so so he's able to see we're just skipping over these lying 
7,0:00:50,0:00:59,SPEAKER 1," What what it's not London where's I'm I'm a filthy Scotsman. Oh no way. Yeah, that's gross, right? Scots are known for going bold "
8,0:01:00,0:01:09,SPEAKER 5, The first bald man was Scottish. Look welcome back. Welcome to the yard to the yard podcast 
9,0:01:10,0:01:14,SPEAKER 3, Darring good for an ace of butterfield. What's up guys? How you doing? Thank you. I'm very well 
10,0:01:14,0:01:58,SPEAKER 5," I actually have I don't know if you remember this, but the first time we met was a beyond the summit event and  Zipper to off camera just now is a big fantasy education and she was really excited that you were at the event  I was like, oh, well, I'll I'll like get a conversation started in some sort and the only conversation we had at the event  Was I talked to you about the days and we we went into like I talked about your asshole  Maybe within the first three seconds of knowing you and you were very down to have that conversation  The problem was that she wasn't she didn't really know how to engage in a conversation about your asshole  And so she didn't really get to talk to you at all. So you know, that was the first time we met  I was just wondering if you remember that I  Vagely, yeah, I was just like hey, he doesn't surprise me that the day is here. You're like, oh, yeah "
11,0:01:59,0:02:08,SPEAKER 4, It was this extremely like-handed conversation because we had I was actually so charmed because Aisa remembered me because we worked on a like we I was doing a 
12,0:02:12,0:02:14,SPEAKER 1, He's still in here 
13,0:02:14,0:02:23,SPEAKER 5, He was like he's like that guy's got a new thing because you had to squint his eyes when you walk in the building  We were in a light and a weird way. I was producing a comedy piece 
14,0:02:23,0:02:26,SPEAKER 1," He saw you today, and he was like that's exactly how I pictured it "
15,0:02:27,0:03:00,SPEAKER 4," We're gonna wait. I was pretty too common piece and we had this idea. I was like oh, it's Butterfield here because it came for the event  to hang out and  With me and Dan were like hey  I wonder if he'd like be down to get in and so we had like this shot of him and it's really funny  He killed the line. You did great and then he remembered that and I was so charmed  Cool as man. I'm very like can I be honest in this being on a circle. Yeah, I'm gonna nervous  Wow, you know when you came in I didn't say hi because I was like how do I fucking how do I deal you guys all  Rock you nervous. I don't know because you know what I don't know wait "
16,0:03:00,0:03:32,SPEAKER 2," I can explain it because I was also nervous because what I did because you were fucking late because you make guys like this  Wait, no, I felt good about that. There was big time and they were both late. Be fair  What I did is I looked up your Instagram and you have like like almost six million followers in it and like millions of likes  And I was like I was a big deal, but then I went to his Twitter and I was like, oh, dude. This is just like a smasher  Retweeted the panic controller and he's like looks good  And I was like to be just a nerd that happens to be a successful actor "
17,0:03:33,0:03:43,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, we talk about it a lot where it's like you'll say something like because you you are you're on liquid  Technically, right? And that's cool. You like announced it and you're like you're in the game "
18,0:03:43,0:03:47,SPEAKER 3, All the replies have no idea what I'm talking about whenever I talk about 
19,0:03:47,0:04:00,SPEAKER 1," Smash okay, that's like what is this? That's the most common thread when we talked about you coming on the show  was this you you like tweet like any normal like guy or like gamer does and then in the reply "
20,0:04:00,0:04:07,SPEAKER 5," You're like yes, M.K. Leo clutched it out again  Someone's just like fucking please come to Brazil. I'm thank you. I "
21,0:04:08,0:04:19,SPEAKER 1, Looked it. I looked at your most recent tweet today. It was like about jackass because I thought it was funny because we had just watched that movie  too and then the first reply is like posting a scene of you kissing somebody in sex education 
22,0:04:21,0:04:23,SPEAKER 2, Do you like Twitter Instagram more? 
23,0:04:25,0:04:43,SPEAKER 3," Well, you just like you're starting out for a while. Yeah, I just I just deleted the app because and I actually deleted Twitter as well  I don't really like either of them hugely sure  If I had to pick one probably Twitter, I think you can like crack jokes and Twitter be easier. Yeah "
24,0:04:43,0:04:47,SPEAKER 2, I think it's a little more like your voice than just like here's me in a picture 
25,0:04:47,0:05:01,SPEAKER 5," But I hate Instagram. I'm terrible. It's just so funny how disconnected the people who follow you are to like the things that you're into outside of acting  Yeah, because you'll just post anything and they're just just like I love you so much and I don't know what you're talking about "
26,0:05:01,0:05:11,SPEAKER 3," How do you reconcile that? Do you do you think I just don't well, I just don't go there  like it's you can I just don't find out to like scroll through it because there's some shit "
27,0:05:13,0:05:23,SPEAKER 4, I read every comment and I've reply to them to this day. I'll call I'll go I'll be like go fuck yourself to this day  I would not make it you're in the difference 
28,0:05:23,0:05:39,SPEAKER 1," The new quality with Twitter is already reaching like a breaking point now  Imagine if you had a his fall away. I'd be so busy. Yeah, somebody would post like some girl would post under like a tweet  You made like please please come hang out with me and you tell them to fuck off "
29,0:05:39,0:05:47,SPEAKER 4," Well, I would just be like that's not what the point of this thread is  In the context of this it's just annoying and you're being annoying and it's like you will "
30,0:05:47,0:05:51,SPEAKER 3, Got it. It'd be it's gonna be like a one-way thing as soon as it starts coming back then 
31,0:05:52,0:06:06,SPEAKER 2," It's yeah, you're a pair of social. I'm not parasocial. Yeah, you're followers. No one opposite of social  No, it's the opposite of parasoaching out to them and talking to them. I don't see the incorrect. This is not the correct  Social or we're not "
32,0:06:06,0:06:17,SPEAKER 5, That's insane. I think the difference maybe is like slime is like fuck off and it's just like a 27-year-old guy  Who is just like into the show if a says fuck off? It might be a 14-year-old girl 
33,0:06:19,0:06:21,SPEAKER 1, She'll be upset 
34,0:06:24,0:06:29,SPEAKER 2, That would ruin them you should do it once just to find out 
35,0:06:30,0:06:36,SPEAKER 4, Here's something I had this idea so it's a bit of an ice break and I think this is important because we're Americans 
36,0:06:36,0:06:43,SPEAKER 3," We have come to your land. My local. This is like my local pub. Is it really? Yeah, I was here not even two days ago "
37,0:06:43,0:06:58,SPEAKER 4," How is that when you come through? I'm sure these kind of like it's over there  The same thing was like do you come through and it's like oh, it's ace of time. Everyone knows or you're just like chill in the back  But like a pub. Yeah, what I'm saying is like how's the vibe when you're hanging out as a as it like you know "
38,0:06:58,0:07:19,SPEAKER 3," Hi, I'm ace, but do people respect you are they yeah for the most part people was like super chill about it  Yeah, and especially like around here. No one really gives a shit sure people just got so much else going on  I can kind of walk down the street and it's fine  We're going to like town like central London then it gets a bit more kind of  Everyone's super nice about it "
39,0:07:19,0:07:35,SPEAKER 2," So have you peed in the trough in the bathroom here? Yeah, yeah, dude  It's scared. I went into the bathroom. You don't like a trough. It's just a trough  It's there's it's there all it's not disconnected  It's a wide for like six. What do you do you guys know have that we do know the thing? We do "
40,0:07:38,0:07:43,SPEAKER 1, Give me one place for the trough. Give me one place. I've been like a concert venue in Seattle 
41,0:07:43,0:07:50,SPEAKER 2," Okay, that was oddly strong a restaurant almost everywhere has specific urinals that that maybe have a separator "
42,0:07:50,0:07:56,SPEAKER 1," You also you also have been to Europe a ton. Yeah, go to France. Yeah, it's way different "
43,0:08:00,0:08:07,SPEAKER 2, Different in France. There's like the bidet that shoots up the water and you you walk over after pooping and it's a different whole thing  It's great 
44,0:08:07,0:08:14,SPEAKER 5, You're oddly specific for a guy who is like mouth should drink an out of a bidet with your mouth. That's true  He's done this on video 
45,0:08:14,0:08:17,SPEAKER 2, For 20 bucks though 20 bucks. You are so proud of that 
46,0:08:18,0:08:38,SPEAKER 4," 20 bucks, you know, I'll still do it. No, you would not I wouldn't why no because we're saying it's Airbnb  That's like really nice. Oh my god three bedrooms for six people. It's like two people per bed like normal people  He's like I don't want to live like a smasher, bro, and he goes and stays in his own hotels  It was a goddamn leather jacket. He's telling me he's gonna drink out of a bidet now "
47,0:08:41,0:08:48,SPEAKER 1, I'll defend you we were at Conor and Schlatz  He set up the bidet and you did it you drank out of it again. He did it the cameras rolling. Yeah 
48,0:08:50,0:08:52,SPEAKER 3," No, he was that like mouth to tap "
49,0:08:55,0:08:59,SPEAKER 2, It was it was no it was like it was shooting and it was like you know like a school you like a school water fountain 
50,0:09:00,0:09:09,SPEAKER 5," When it's like some kids just kind of  Yeah, he was he was just he had to like stretch his lips so he could get it all the way over the water couldn't come out fast enough "
51,0:09:09,0:09:12,SPEAKER 2," I was like Kirby in the new ad. Yeah, I had the whole mouth over it. I was just like "
52,0:09:13,0:09:15,SPEAKER 4, I went Kirby on the bidet 
53,0:09:16,0:09:25,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, get a little nuts. Yeah, there's nothing wrong with it. Also, I did not say you live in some smash brothel  I got a recommendation for a hotel "
54,0:09:25,0:09:27,SPEAKER 4," No, you told Nick. I don't want it "
55,0:09:29,0:09:33,SPEAKER 2, I think Anthony orders places to live like a smasher and a degree to me 
56,0:09:34,0:09:42,SPEAKER 1," Are you no? I said yeah, I think that's fair  We like we booked this place we booked this place like we would when we went to smasher and it's all the time "
57,0:09:42,0:09:52,SPEAKER 5, I feel like it's the same level of this is also this is also so classic by the way the like like we have like a netflix actor on the show and  I don't think we've talked to him once 
58,0:09:55,0:10:06,SPEAKER 4," All right. Oh, yeah, yeah, let's circle back  Trops fine. You're afraid of male sexuality. I am  Clearly men scare me. Okay, the second part you should try it with the trough "
59,0:10:07,0:10:09,SPEAKER 2, I'll drink this and if you want to pee with me in the trough later 
60,0:10:12,0:10:26,SPEAKER 4," Okay, so we're we've been in in this this beautiful magical land of swords and dragons and we have a problem where we talk like  British people disrespectfully. He's using we really "
61,0:10:26,0:10:30,SPEAKER 1," Oh, you don't do it. No, I do Australian. He's the dude. Oh, you know, I got a "
62,0:10:31,0:10:36,SPEAKER 2," Which is fine in this land because we don't respect Australians here. Okay, true, but listen "
63,0:10:36,0:10:45,SPEAKER 4," I think I think for give us like 10 seconds  We get all of our accents out. Oh, that means we don't do accents for the rest of the episode as respect "
64,0:10:45,0:10:50,SPEAKER 2, And then could you rank who is the best in the worst? I'll be happy to but we need to do it all at once 
65,0:10:51,0:10:56,SPEAKER 3, Friends episode when they when they play all of them over each other you guys do like British accents is that like you're one of your things 
66,0:10:56,0:11:01,SPEAKER 5, Losely you could say you could say that we do it at home. Like if we're getting coffee is like oh come get coffee with me 
67,0:11:06,0:11:08,SPEAKER 1, So strong 
68,0:11:08,0:11:10,SPEAKER 2, He does use me a lot because I don't say that 
69,0:11:12,0:11:25,SPEAKER 3," Okay, well, okay, so on the count of I mean that was like sort of like 60s cockney like  You're really found yeah, I'm giving him something "
70,0:11:25,0:11:31,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, all right, so you want down the line and get it all out down the line go down the line start with Nick go down the line "
71,0:11:32,0:11:37,SPEAKER 5," Give me said let's go. I didn't know where to do this last time  Prepared oh, yeah, I love "
72,0:11:41,0:11:45,SPEAKER 4," Here we go. Oh, I'm fucking James. Oh, no, I'm fucking shagging Judy. Don't "
73,0:11:45,0:11:52,SPEAKER 3, He looks disgusted he looks disgusted with you sound like sort of rustle brand 
74,0:11:55,0:12:00,SPEAKER 2," It is a little yeah, he's watching rosses YouTube I guess so angry "
75,0:12:04,0:12:06,SPEAKER 3, And James one doesn't talk like that 
76,0:12:09,0:12:11,SPEAKER 2, Just finished kill the man what a shag 
77,0:12:12,0:12:14,SPEAKER 1, Ha 
78,0:12:14,0:12:22,SPEAKER 2," That's classic body. All right, he's actually gonna apply that got his blood week  Hi, the morning pussy "
79,0:12:24,0:12:26,SPEAKER 5, Too we're gonna get fucking kicked out 
80,0:12:33,0:12:35,SPEAKER 2, I gotta be talk to 
81,0:12:36,0:12:46,SPEAKER 1, You're in the car  It is more embarrassing. What is Brexit?  I'll think I'll be close to the fine department 
82,0:12:50,0:12:55,SPEAKER 5," Now asa has to do his one American that's right. Yeah, we can get out of the segment before he does it every time "
83,0:12:56,0:13:04,SPEAKER 4, Our friend Josh says every time or Mike says every time someone does an American accent. It's like British  They sound like JFK which I think is really fun 
84,0:13:04,0:13:08,SPEAKER 2," You're an actor you've certainly done a role before where you're American right yeah, yeah, I've been paid to do an American accent "
85,0:13:08,0:13:14,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, so I would hope it's okay. Yeah, they give you money for it. You're seeing I'm the president. You're my son "
86,0:13:16,0:13:18,SPEAKER 2, And I have to kiss you on the mouth 
87,0:13:20,0:13:38,SPEAKER 4," And I'm going in and I'm breaking some news to you. Oh, what's up. Hey, it's all good  You can go through. Yeah, all good. This is a semi-active space  All right  Sun here's the thing I just I can't uh, I can't go with you because there's a war going on. I got to be the president "
88,0:13:39,0:13:47,SPEAKER 3," Uh, you're my adult son. Okay, um, there's a war  Uh, what did you start the war for? "
89,0:13:50,0:13:52,SPEAKER 2, It's a great question 
90,0:13:52,0:13:56,SPEAKER 1," He's much more reasonable as a human dude. Yeah, this is Southern draw "
91,0:13:57,0:14:01,SPEAKER 3, I can't tell it was not intentional. That was good. I can't tell what that person's from 
92,0:14:01,0:14:03,SPEAKER 5," Yeah, they're not from L.A. He's a male "
93,0:14:03,0:14:20,SPEAKER 3," Whenever they asked me to do an American accent. I just try and make it as like generic as possible  As soon as you try and do like a Southern or like a New York accent people from me up  We like that doesn't sound like I love hamburger. You gotta go really  Like non-descript that was good. Yeah, we it was like right there. It was pretty good. I was like a Texas "
94,0:14:21,0:14:23,SPEAKER 1," You know, we were a Texas sunlight Texas straw "
95,0:14:24,0:14:33,SPEAKER 2, You're bad president  I needed to do that the war was necessary now go through who who do you think British wise who had the best yeah 
96,0:14:36,0:14:41,SPEAKER 3, I might give it a slime  Just for the commitment 
97,0:14:41,0:14:56,SPEAKER 5," He fully embodied it yet it in his arms. This is like this is the guy who was just running through the streets of London with the  Austin Powers theme song literally playing in his head  And he was just pushing people around  It's like random people. Yeah, not a person. That'd be terrible. Yeah, that's "
98,0:14:56,0:15:20,SPEAKER 1," This is when we were walking over. I was thinking about this earlier. We were walking over to the pub today  Just walking by homes  Out front in somebody's yard. There's just an open  porn magazine dude just in this just in the yard of somebody's house. It said like wank tonight  It was crazy. I was like who's wanking in the front y'all are zombies. It's okay. So he's just a resident in the front. Yeah, that's a lot "
99,0:15:20,0:15:22,SPEAKER 5, That's a low here 
100,0:15:23,0:15:24,SPEAKER 4, Just the male 
101,0:15:24,0:15:29,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, it's crazy. It's the what the male?  The male is in like he's gonna take it back "
102,0:15:30,0:15:32,SPEAKER 4, The male 
103,0:15:32,0:15:34,SPEAKER 2, Just like the male 
104,0:15:34,0:15:36,SPEAKER 3, That's I was just I was just making sure that's what you said thank god. That's all right 
105,0:15:37,0:15:46,SPEAKER 4, Just a bit of a trump check. Can I can I be maybe I'm the only one here?  I haven't seen a single thing that you've done actually not out of some sort of protest  That's just never crossed my path 
106,0:15:46,0:15:52,SPEAKER 5," That's all right. No, I haven't either but also out of in protest  That's actually that's actually really I'm protesting gamers who are actors "
107,0:15:54,0:15:59,SPEAKER 1, They had to pick it's either gaming or actually it's like it's like him and the guy from the Witcher 
108,0:15:59,0:16:01,SPEAKER 3," I will say though. I want like an Henry Cavalman. Yeah, yeah "
109,0:16:02,0:16:04,SPEAKER 1, He also hates Henry because he's just talking about video games all the time 
110,0:16:05,0:16:37,SPEAKER 5," You are in this like beautiful zone because you've been acting for a super long time where we've had certain people  We've told we're coming here to do this. We're like, oh, it's you know, it's about a few and they freak out  And like huge fantasy sex education like you know our age etc  And then there's other people like I've just never heard of that actor  But then there's people like zipper two's grandmother who also freaked out  And was naming all of your older movies. We call her zipper epsilon  And yeah, you're in like this interesting zone where it's like there's like people who I guess like a question  I would have is like you is mostly what you get recognized for on the street today like sex education "
111,0:16:38,0:16:56,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, it is now. Yeah, I think I just before that Netflix is just so huge  Yeah, yeah, like you do something on that and  And watch it anywhere in the world like at any time and the show was a huge success and because it's British  Particularly in the UK everyone watched it. Mm-hmm whether you're like my age or older. It's kind of the UK small "
112,0:16:56,0:17:12,SPEAKER 2," UK is small. It's like small in Texas. Tommy and it's like a celebrity here  Yeah, he's like a big like everybody recognizes him  Because like small and he's like 20 million subscribers and there's like  What 13 million people in the UK is that totally our face 30 million? No, it's like 65 "
113,0:17:13,0:17:21,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, okay, I'm a little off. I'm a little off. I'm like when I'm just guessing  Yeah, we are to say we're the same. I shouldn't do that anymore "
114,0:17:21,0:17:27,SPEAKER 2," Well, that's high before I say the enders game, but you were a kid. I was a kid. Is that weird? I was like 15 "
115,0:17:27,0:17:33,SPEAKER 3," That was that was the first film I did. We had an American accent really. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, did you have to get like a coach for that? "
116,0:17:33,0:17:38,SPEAKER 5," Uh-huh. Oh shit. Yeah, dialect coach. Would you dialect coach American or just someone who understands? "
117,0:17:38,0:17:43,SPEAKER 3," He was a man. Yeah, but you kind of get people from all over. Yeah, I could be a dialect coach "
118,0:17:44,0:17:45,SPEAKER 5, I could 
119,0:17:45,0:18:03,SPEAKER 2," But it wouldn't be for American to be for British  Yeah, jar for money. I embarrassingly thought you were America. I was like the Tom Holland bit  You ever see that where does the interview and the guys like I thought you're American because he's British in the interview  He's like no, I'm pretending. How do you do that? "
120,0:18:04,0:18:36,SPEAKER 3," When you're in America when I'm working America, I do just start talking to Americans and even when I'm no working really  You kind of get a bit of a chameleon. Yeah, and you just start saying that you do that socially because people are doing it around you  Or you do it to practice. You do it subconsciously. I see like I'm not even aware of it  And then also does just start slipping into slight America. I came back after doing enders game  I came across my school and I was like why do you sound like American like and my little sister  Three of the  From she was from New Orleans  Because that's where we're shooting. She was like three years old and she's like my name's "
121,0:18:38,0:18:53,SPEAKER 5," Just sponge at that point. Yeah, yeah, I was I was just what I was asking this question on the plan over here  Like at what age when you go to another country  Do you like just not pick the accent up like if I turn 30 and then I go move to London for the rest of my life  Well, I think I think it's more of a "
122,0:18:54,0:19:06,SPEAKER 3, But people I don't even think certainly about age actually. I think some people are just more prone to it  Like you like there are people as there's a name for it.

166,0:23:51,0:23:55,SPEAKER 4, Asus shows up to the croc. Maybe he's got a gamecube controller. He's like oh fuck 
167,0:23:57,0:24:00,SPEAKER 5, How how did you start playing smash? 
168,0:24:01,0:24:27,SPEAKER 3," Um  Like I played I played melee when I was a kid on the gamecube  But I was like I don't know how old not enough to like I was just down being with Bowser the entire time  That's all I remember how a natural Bowser chooser. Yeah, not a lot of you in the world. No  And then I got  Roll when it came out  But even then I was just kind of playing it for fun. Uh-huh. I didn't get to like competitive smash to like  Been a while. I mean like five "
169,0:24:27,0:24:32,SPEAKER 5," Five years ago. Oh, I mean, that's quite a while. So you started with smash for competitively me too "

174,0:24:43,0:24:50,SPEAKER 2," Okay, Pikachu's decent Pikachu's really good. Pikachu fucked at my local  Like there's Pikachu guys who showed up and I was like oh come on "
175,0:24:51,0:24:56,SPEAKER 3, Like one win today. Jigs was like the worst character in the game literally the worst. Yeah 
176,0:24:56,0:25:22,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, my my logic was I used jigglypuff in in brawl because I'd play with like a free for all my friends  And if you lost you get to pick the map so I'd go bridge of Elden  Oh, and you do that roll out on the left side. You've never changed. I was that what you could put you could pick that map when you play  Is that like the not like competitive? Just like for my friends  And then when I went to like competitive events. I was like, oh, I'll just do this again  And it's different when there's only one person there "
177,0:25:23,0:25:30,SPEAKER 5," Yeah, they are getting panced and like putting lockers. Yeah, that's which off. It was tough  Wait on, so how did you start playing competitively like where do you find that? "
178,0:25:30,0:25:44,SPEAKER 3," Um, I went there's like I there's a few locals in London and I went to my one which is actually literally down the road from where I live  Um, I was at this pub this bar called Mountdown  And it's like the biggest local in London and I just start playing to the plays there "
179,0:25:45,0:25:48,SPEAKER 2, You kind of got to know people in the scene. Wow. Were they nice and cool

181,0:25:54,0:26:20,SPEAKER 2," I embarrassingly admit this but at the ASU local I had like 120 people at Arizona  University of the college I went to and  And it was like mostly dudes in the bathrooms were filthy and I'm very  In like I have a little pierrisis  It's the medical condition of P shyness like a baby version of it where if it's like really filthy  I can't be in public and so I'd go to the girls bathroom really yeah, and it was a ghost town "
182,0:26:20,0:26:23,SPEAKER 5, It was a ghost town. You're just an empath man. Yeah 
183,0:26:24,0:26:28,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, and  And I and I would have never admitted it back then, but I'll say it now "
184,0:26:29,0:26:39,SPEAKER 4, Did you ever go into the girls bathroom by accident?  You're not looking or something and it's just stalls you're like what the fuck?  You're like mr. Crab's meme and then you run out because you're embarrassed. You just stay in there 
185,0:26:41,0:26:43,SPEAKER 1, I'm like if I'm already here 
186,0:26:43,0:26:45,SPEAKER 2, What is well figured out they're always nicer

Here's the clip  You're going for why Ludwig I think if you ever have lived with a girl  They're just grosser on average. They have they have like way more shit. They're way messier. They "
189,0:27:06,0:27:25,SPEAKER 5," It's all it's all the only thing the only place. I think I've seen consistently messier is like the area around your sink  Yeah, then they will fuck your sink up. That's true with debris. They throw it looks like a fucking it looks like the hangover in there  Yeah, it's like there's just fucking shit  There's like open makeup everywhere. There's like wipes with like all sorts of colors on them "
190,0:27:26,0:27:30,SPEAKER 4," Oh, true true. You're trying to get in almost like the wind alert. Yeah, okay, so "
191,0:27:30,0:27:34,SPEAKER 5, Someone really wants a storm happening. There's a storm happening in London right now if you guys didn't know it 
192,0:27:34,0:27:39,SPEAKER 4," It's red it's red alert. Oh, it's someone with a package. We'll let him figure it out. That's all right "
193,0:27:39,0:27:44,SPEAKER 2, It's red alert in in in London. I literally never seen I had a thing on my phone said red alert in London 
194,0:27:44,0:27:47,SPEAKER 3, I've never seen that before. What does it mean? I don't know no one knows what it means 
195,0:27:51,0:28:00,SPEAKER 2," I know because it's on the radio if there's a red alert until 3 p.m  It's recommended to stay indoors for this time and the guy almost did this outside. Yeah, that would have been terrible "
196,0:28:00,0:28:04,SPEAKER 3," That would have been fun though. We would have been fucked, right? I appreciate it. They're like us like blowing "
197,0:28:05,0:28:13,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, they're great. Oh me oh me showed us that video before we started and it was just a trash bin  In the air blowing through a neighborhood "
198,0:28:13,0:28:19,SPEAKER 4," But like way above the homes like like a bird in the sky. Yeah, like it was when that lands "
199,0:28:19,0:28:24,SPEAKER 5," It's gonna be it'll fuck someone somebody's getting knocked out. Yeah, it might be in Los Angeles when it lands "
200,0:28:24,0:28:27,SPEAKER 2, It's good. It's gonna go for a while. It's the new jackass. They're filming it. Steve goes in there 
201,0:28:30,0:28:37,SPEAKER 3, Dude new jackass pretty fucking. It was wild. I saw it. I saw it. I went like with low expectations 
202,0:28:37,0:28:45,SPEAKER 5, That was just like I feel like  The series isn't what it used to be probably and I'm all blah blah  But then I went I saw it was like wow they made it good jackass. Yeah in 2021 
203,0:28:45,0:28:52,SPEAKER 3, I found it weird because whenever I watch jackass it's been like I see I said jackass  Like an American right then jackass. Jackass doesn't have the same old mind 
204,0:28:54,0:28:56,SPEAKER 1, Jackass 
205,0:28:57,0:29:03,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, I watch it and I was laughing  Straight off rib at the ball sack, but then they were kept getting hurt and I was like "
206,0:29:04,0:29:07,SPEAKER 3, The one dude who kept getting his nuts like dude 
207,0:29:08,0:29:13,SPEAKER 2, That was that got hard to work. I was like you got on a big screen. They said I'll lock that guy in a room and shot him 
208,0:29:13,0:29:23,SPEAKER 1," Like they were just walking with him the whole movie the bear thing the bear thing at the end of the movie is  Maybe the most insane thing I've ever seen. Yeah, I didn't fuck with the psychological torture of it "
209,0:29:24,0:29:29,SPEAKER 2," I think I think why why not it made me feel bad. Oh, and I would just wanted to see more penises in the club "
210,0:29:31,0:29:37,SPEAKER 3," To the penis I need more ball more ball the dinosaur dick at the beginning. Yeah, it was icon. It was so good "
211,0:29:37,0:29:58,SPEAKER 5," I think the one thing the movie did a lot more that like older jackasses didn't was like a there was more like  Real stunts but fake situations like for exact he's like hanging from the the phone line. Oh, yeah  That's definitely like a sad actor or whatever, but he's for she's doing it. So it's like partly  It's like oh, he's doing a stunt  But this is not a real they're not going to fucking Wendy's and yelling fire in the hole and throwing a milkshake "
212,0:29:58,0:30:07,SPEAKER 3, I don't think they can't get away with it now everyone knows who they are. I don't think they can get away with it  It's like it's like Borat like he can't yeah make these stunts  How he used to because everyone knows it's 
213,0:30:07,0:30:18,SPEAKER 1, It's immediately what I think he only the only things that soccer bearer Cohen can get away with anymore is when he's like  Kaked in like six layers of makeup like he just has to be completely unrecognizable or 
214,0:30:19,0:30:21,SPEAKER 2, Jackass in India 
215,0:30:22,0:30:27,SPEAKER 4, I'm sure there's a thing you say that it probably already exists and have seven seven sequels 
216,0:30:27,0:30:34,SPEAKER 1, Like the volume industry is only way too big for that to know  There's just no way that 
217,0:30:34,0:30:44,SPEAKER 4," Let me try to find out that's right. I have a question. They say if the jackass guys call you up  And they say hey, we're doing another one. We want you to come on. We don't know the stunt  Are you interested? "
218,0:30:44,0:30:46,SPEAKER 3, Do I have to get my thick and bulls up? 
219,0:30:46,0:30:50,SPEAKER 5, You don't know but you have to give them this one bangers and mad 
220,0:30:53,0:30:55,SPEAKER 1, It's just smashing your stick with a hammer 
221,0:31:01,0:31:15,SPEAKER 3," Answer your question  Probably not really well, I feel like you would be so on edge the entire time on that shoot because there's not just the stunts  That she can happen to you at any time  Yeah, you like step out of a door "
222,0:31:15,0:31:16,SPEAKER 5, Like you go for coffee and you get punched in the face 
223,0:31:16,0:31:17,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, that's what they would do "
224,0:31:17,0:31:23,SPEAKER 2, Like you would just be a celebrity on set who would watch the things  But then they'd also try to like just hate you in the face really hard once 
225,0:31:23,0:31:24,SPEAKER 3, It sounds so stressful 
226,0:31:24,0:31:37,SPEAKER 2," It is I imagine  But I also feel like this is something okay, maybe I'm off base. I feel like you could  Do it not saying you want to  But like are you not just in the position where you could be like  Johnny "
227,0:31:38,0:31:39,SPEAKER 1, Hey 
228,0:31:39,0:31:42,SPEAKER 2," Shootin' a new jackass, you boy Acer  And you'd be like oh yeah, come down "
229,0:31:42,0:31:45,SPEAKER 4, Like the way I don't think we'll call Mr. Beast

271,0:33:16,0:33:21,SPEAKER 2," No I did it because last time I called it  It was like  Bob, Bob  The number you have reached has disconnected "
272,0:33:21,0:33:22,SPEAKER 3, That was pretty good 
273,0:33:22,0:33:23,SPEAKER 2," So, I thought he was going to do that "
274,0:33:23,0:33:24,SPEAKER 3, Is that his voice? 
275,0:33:24,0:33:25,SPEAKER 2," But, no "
276,0:33:25,0:33:27,SPEAKER 1, Was that the number?  People in the 
277,0:33:28,0:33:31,SPEAKER 4," It was Mr. Beast saying that  He's like  Ah, shit "
278,0:33:31,0:33:37,SPEAKER 2, That's I think  Either someone got that number  or that was Mr. Beast and then I fucked up. 
279,0:33:37,0:33:38,SPEAKER 4," Wow, again. "
280,0:33:38,0:33:40,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, you probably woke that poor man up. "
281,0:33:40,0:33:45,SPEAKER 2," Sorry, I'll be fine.  He's only slightly busy. "
282,0:33:45,0:33:54,SPEAKER 4," What's your days filled with?  I know it's like you work a lot, and then it's like,  but then you have time off a lot.  You just vibe, you just vibe all day. "
283,0:33:54,0:34:03,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, it's pretty great.  When I'm not working, it's pretty chill.  What time are you waking up these days?  Actually, all right, like nine. "
284,0:34:03,0:34:05,SPEAKER 5," Oh, you're healthy individual. "
285,0:34:05,0:34:10,SPEAKER 2," He said all right, like normally it's seven on a work day  and like nine's like, I'm lazy to say it. "
286,0:34:10,0:34:12,SPEAKER 1, I'm sleeping in. 
287,0:34:12,0:34:25,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, I mean, you're right.  When I'm working, it's like you're up early  and it's you're like in a bubble  and that's like your life for two months, three months.  When you're not, what could it do?  I just like play games and be friends. "
288,0:34:25,0:34:28,SPEAKER 4," Do you love, are you living the dream?  Would you say you are? "
289,0:34:28,0:34:30,SPEAKER 3, I'm living my dream. 
290,0:34:30,0:35:01,SPEAKER 1," I did want to ask you a question about this actually  because you have been acting for so long  and you started, started like when you were pretty young.  How do you, like when you start that young  with something and you're still doing it now,  how do you know that that is like your passion  or the thing you want to do?  Like, did you just happen to fall into it  and it's worked out this whole time?  Have you ever wanted to like go off and pursue something else?  Like, how do you know that this is like  this is my life's passion and what I'm going to stick with? "
291,0:35:01,0:35:31,SPEAKER 3," Well, I didn't for a while.  Like when I started acting, I didn't like intend  to be an actor growing up.  I didn't go to the drama school.  I didn't kind of really do any of that.  I mostly learnt on the job.  It wasn't until I got older and I was like 14-ish,  13-14 and I was still working  and I think it was when I did Hugo that I really kind of,  I guess understood what acting was.  Up until then, I just, when you're a kid and you're acting,  you just kind of winging it. "
292,0:35:31,0:35:34,SPEAKER 2," You're saying in the boy in the striped pajamas,  you're a winging it. "
293,0:35:34,0:35:37,SPEAKER 1," Kind of, yeah. "
294,0:35:37,0:35:39,SPEAKER 3," I mean, I was like 10 years old. "
295,0:35:39,0:35:40,SPEAKER 2, I'm an Oscar-winning movie. 
296,0:35:40,0:35:42,SPEAKER 4, 10 years old. 
297,0:35:42,0:35:43,SPEAKER 1," You're like, I don't know. "
298,0:35:43,0:35:44,SPEAKER 2, I guess I got pajamas. 
299,0:35:44,0:35:45,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
300,0:35:45,0:35:56,SPEAKER 3," You just have, it's like, make believe when you're a kid  and you're just like making shit up.  And when you're older, you kind of have all of these  like things you get embarrassed about.  When you're at that age, you don't really get a shit.  Yeah, you can kind of, that's interesting. "
301,0:35:57,0:36:03,SPEAKER 5," I've never really thought about like, as you get older,  you're like propensity to be embarrassed.  It's just so much higher that that's not true. "
302,0:36:03,0:36:08,SPEAKER 4," You're fucking lying.  Here's why I, my friend has your experience. "
303,0:36:08,0:36:09,SPEAKER 5, You want to talk. 
304,0:36:09,0:36:25,SPEAKER 4," I did, I did a Christmas play  and I was a candy player.  Oh, no, no, this really happened.  I was a candy flute and it was the nutcracker.  Okay, I was a Christmas play.  I at the time was grounded because I put salmon in my pocket. "
305,0:36:25,0:36:29,SPEAKER 1," Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. "
306,0:36:29,0:36:33,SPEAKER 5," You were, you got grounded by your parents.  It's always some shit, because you had salmon in your pocket. "
307,0:36:33,0:36:42,SPEAKER 1," I can't even, I've seen, I've seen it in my pocket.  And then, and then I also had a shock ball around it.  My, my friends let a bear into the room.  Dude, you, what was it? "
308,0:36:42,0:36:45,SPEAKER 5, You just had a fish in your pocket  and your parents said this is groundable. 
309,0:36:45,0:36:48,SPEAKER 4, He did it with every day.  He just can't fucking let me be. 
310,0:36:48,0:36:49,SPEAKER 1, I can't be me. 
311,0:36:49,0:36:50,SPEAKER 5, I can't believe it. 
312,0:36:50,0:36:50,SPEAKER 2, He's not on your side. 
313,0:36:50,0:37:19,SPEAKER 4," Listen to me.  I got fucking grounded because I hated eating fish  and my mom ate salmon for dinner.  And, and so I fucking, so you put it in your pocket and put it in my pocket.  When she wasn't looking, I like took a filet of salmon.  So, I just put it in my pants pocket, like my front part,  you were these quarter riser and my favorite pair of pants.  I put it in there and just forgot about it.  So, so, so that night actually, she does laundry.  I'm like, pen and, "
314,0:37:19,0:37:22,SPEAKER 5, I don't even forget about a full layer. 
315,0:37:22,0:38:03,SPEAKER 4," I'm like, in my room.  She's like, what the fuck is this?  And, and she comes out and she's screaming at me.  I'm like, oh, you lost my pocket fish.  I was like, you got me, like I hate fish.  Grounded me for a week, but that's,  side of the point, she, my, my, my play, she said,  like the play isn't something I desperately wanted to do,  but she was like, you're going.  This is school, okay?  I don't give a shit.  I'm gonna drive you, you're gonna do your play,  but you're still grounded and I'm like, okay, that's fun.  It's actually really fun, but they made me a candy flutes.  We had like 13 of us wear candy flutes,  but they made the costume.  I was the last one to get a costume.  Here's all of them.  Here's how tall they are.  Here's mine.  Do you understand the problem there? "
316,0:38:03,0:38:04,SPEAKER 2, Black sheep. 
317,0:38:04,0:38:12,SPEAKER 4," I was the fucking tiny candy flute.  I was pissed.  I tell the teacher, why is mine smaller than everyone else's?  You know what she said?  It's a magic one. "
318,0:38:12,0:38:13,SPEAKER 1, Wow. 
319,0:38:13,0:38:14,SPEAKER 2, Yeah. 
320,0:38:14,0:38:16,SPEAKER 4, Did you believe it?  Did you believe it? 
321,0:38:16,0:38:18,SPEAKER 2, Fuck no.  Of course not. 
322,0:38:18,0:38:19,SPEAKER 1, Pocket salmon boy doesn't believe it. 
323,0:38:19,0:38:20,SPEAKER 4, I went out there. 
324,0:38:20,0:38:25,SPEAKER 5," He's like, this is ridiculous.  He's like taking bits of salmon.  I was pocket and popping him like go. "
325,0:38:25,0:38:29,SPEAKER 1, He really like tots and Napoleon dynamite.  I just got chunks of salmon. 
326,0:38:29,0:38:32,SPEAKER 4, I went out there.  I was a candy flute and I was fucking. 
327,0:38:32,0:38:35,SPEAKER 3," Wait, what is a candy flute?  This is like an American thing. "
328,0:38:35,0:38:36,SPEAKER 5, I was accepting this. 
329,0:38:36,0:38:37,SPEAKER 1, I don't know. 
330,0:38:37,0:38:44,SPEAKER 4," I don't know what the fuck it is either.  I don't know.  I don't know what the fuck it is either.  Cracker, it's like, you're a,  maybe he's like candy flute.  It was like a candy cane flute. "
331,0:38:44,0:38:45,SPEAKER 3, Like the musical instrument. 
332,0:38:45,0:38:51,SPEAKER 4," The flute?  Yeah, yeah.  It's like a flute made of candy,  but it was really just a cardboard cylinder that was painted  that the kids got into. "
333,0:38:51,0:38:54,SPEAKER 2," Look, Jack Husky was fucking high when he wrote that shit. "
334,0:38:54,0:38:56,SPEAKER 1, He was.  You were in some outfit. 
335,0:38:56,0:38:58,SPEAKER 4," I was, he, I was letting his vision come down. "
336,0:38:58,0:39:00,SPEAKER 2, Have you seen the Nutcracker? 
337,0:39:00,0:39:02,SPEAKER 3, I actually have.  Yeah. 
338,0:39:02,0:39:05,SPEAKER 2," When I was a kid.  It was like the sugar plum fairy.  Like people run into her skirt, "
339,0:39:05,0:39:06,SPEAKER 4, and then they run out. 
340,0:39:06,0:39:12,SPEAKER 2," Really?  It's a whole thing, dude.  A lot of it's why.  I've watched it every year for 14 years straight.  Why? "
341,0:39:12,0:39:13,SPEAKER 5, Because my sister was in ballet. 
342,0:39:13,0:39:15,SPEAKER 4," Oh, I thought you meant like that. "
343,0:39:15,0:39:20,SPEAKER 5, Makes way more than that.  Was it crossover with you watching that every year for 14 years  straight and giving your ass? 
344,0:39:20,0:39:28,SPEAKER 2," Was it one?  No, there was not.  And don't need to bring that up.  And I do remember one guy watching me.  I was like, what a short fucking candy flute.  What a cringity it. "
345,0:39:28,0:39:42,SPEAKER 4," If you watched my play,  you would have been blown away by my skills,  and then disgusted that they put me in the short one.  Okay.  So what I'm saying is,  it's a lie because I was embarrassed.  It wasn't make believe.  I didn't believe it was magic.  And that's why I didn't pursue acting.  That's why I'm not in your chair. "
346,0:39:42,0:39:43,SPEAKER 1, You could have been bald. 
347,0:39:43,0:39:45,SPEAKER 3, Are you still embarrassed about it? 
348,0:39:45,0:39:46,SPEAKER 5," Are you still embarrassed about it, man? "
349,0:39:46,0:39:47,SPEAKER 2, Yeah. 
350,0:39:47,0:39:51,SPEAKER 4," I'm not embarrassed, but I literally think about it.  And I still exist. "
351,0:39:51,0:39:54,SPEAKER 3, Is this just like a therapy session for you guys?  Yeah. 
352,0:39:54,0:39:56,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.  Yeah. 
353,0:39:56,0:39:57,SPEAKER 4, That's all I'm saying. 
354,0:39:57,0:39:59,SPEAKER 2," And then once celebrity,  he will say something out of pocket about. "
355,0:39:59,0:40:00,SPEAKER 3, I've never said any. 
356,0:40:00,0:40:02,SPEAKER 4, No.  We've been fine. 
357,0:40:02,0:40:03,SPEAKER 1," No, no, no, no. "
358,0:40:03,0:40:06,SPEAKER 2, Not him.  Just a celebrity.  You will say something out of pocket about. 
359,0:40:06,0:40:07,SPEAKER 4, We've been. 
360,0:40:07,0:40:08,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
361,0:40:08,0:40:09,SPEAKER 2, Jesse Eisenberg. 
362,0:40:09,0:40:10,SPEAKER 1," Oh, I'll know. "
363,0:40:10,0:40:15,SPEAKER 4, I do think that I could take Justin Long.  Have you met Justin Long? 
364,0:40:15,0:40:20,SPEAKER 1, Have you fought Justin Long?  Have you fought Justin Long?  Maybe you did me.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
365,0:40:20,0:40:24,SPEAKER 4, I fought it and met you in that order. 
366,0:40:24,0:40:34,SPEAKER 2," Anyway, you're living the dream.  You're big chilling now.  Day to day.  I think we touched a bit of it.  But day in the life, walk me through you wake up at 9.  Then what? "
367,0:40:34,0:40:38,SPEAKER 3, Gaming.  I try not to do that immediately. 
368,0:40:38,0:40:42,SPEAKER 1, Like.  I think there's in math.  Yeah. 
369,0:40:42,0:40:43,SPEAKER 3, The back. 
370,0:40:43,0:40:44,SPEAKER 2, Yeah. 
371,0:40:44,0:40:51,SPEAKER 3," The last few weeks, um, wake up.  Feed my cats.  I got two cats. "
372,0:40:51,0:40:53,SPEAKER 4," Oh, yeah.  Types names. "
373,0:40:53,0:40:55,SPEAKER 3," Uh, they're called Atlas and Lyra. "
374,0:40:55,0:40:56,SPEAKER 5," Oh, my. "
375,0:40:56,0:40:57,SPEAKER 2, Are they COVID cats? 
376,0:40:57,0:40:59,SPEAKER 3," No, I got them just before COVID. "
377,0:40:59,0:41:02,SPEAKER 5," Our, our, one of our very good friends is last name is Lyra. "
378,0:41:02,0:41:03,SPEAKER 3," Oh, yeah. "
379,0:41:03,0:41:04,SPEAKER 4, That's right. 
380,0:41:04,0:41:05,SPEAKER 3, He's your cat. 
381,0:41:05,0:41:06,SPEAKER 2, That's. 
382,0:41:06,0:41:08,SPEAKER 5, He's our cat.  Our friend is your cat. 
383,0:41:08,0:41:10,SPEAKER 1, He's also Australian.  He does those in love. 
384,0:41:10,0:41:12,SPEAKER 5, It's a whole thing.  We'll keep going though. 
385,0:41:12,0:41:21,SPEAKER 3," Feed your cats.  Um, I don't know.  Like, play some games.  Try and meet up with some people.  Maybe go for a bike ride. "
386,0:41:21,0:41:22,SPEAKER 1," Um, stay fit. "
387,0:41:22,0:41:23,SPEAKER 2, Be social. 
388,0:41:23,0:41:25,SPEAKER 3," Exactly.  Like, wife. "
389,0:41:25,0:41:27,SPEAKER 1," You're on your diet.  Do you have to like, do you work stuff? "
390,0:41:27,0:41:33,SPEAKER 2," Do you have to be like, I have to field this call.  Or is that all taken care of until you have to show up to work? "
391,0:41:33,0:41:49,SPEAKER 3," No, I have like, either like, meetings of directors or scripts to read.  Yeah.  Or just calls for like projects I'm doing.  Not that regularly because film industry moves so slow.  Like, you have a call and then you won't hear anything for a month.  And then you might have another meeting.  Are you like, is it still happening? "
392,0:41:49,0:41:50,SPEAKER 2, Or does it just? 
393,0:41:50,0:42:02,SPEAKER 3," Yeah.  Oh, like, there are so many times I've had a project which has been supposed to be made for like four years now.  And every time they say this is going to happen, it doesn't happen.  And that is kind of normal. "
394,0:42:02,0:42:04,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.  That makes sense. 
395,0:42:04,0:42:19,SPEAKER 2," I think it's similar in, in like streaming YouTube gaming world is,  is people like bring up like, oh, we're going to do this.  And then like, it never fucking happens ever.  They always over promise.  And then over hyped the timeline.  And then it's like, oh, wait, it's a lot of money and a lot of time and a lot of effort.  And we can't make it happen. "
396,0:42:19,0:42:22,SPEAKER 4, But that's just other streamers being debarers. 
397,0:42:22,0:42:32,SPEAKER 2," Even eSports orgs, you know, I think make a lot of promises.  I mean, even in Smash, there's 300 different, what do you call them?  One of the things I get canceled every other week. "
398,0:42:32,0:42:33,SPEAKER 5," Oh, Smashers. "
399,0:42:33,0:42:37,SPEAKER 1, You said you said you said you said you said it. 
400,0:42:37,0:42:38,SPEAKER 3, I don't know. 
401,0:42:38,0:42:39,SPEAKER 1, Welcome back. 
402,0:42:39,0:42:43,SPEAKER 4, I saw the matrix when he started asking the question.  I saw the matrix in front of me. 
403,0:42:43,0:42:53,SPEAKER 5," So would you say that like most of your improvement as an actor comes on the job,  or do you think you do spend a lot of time like outside of specifically acting in movies?  Like thinking about a working on it things like that? "
404,0:42:53,0:43:13,SPEAKER 3," Not a huge amount.  I wasn't like, classically trained.  Yeah.  So I wouldn't say I'm, I don't practice acting  in the kind of traditional fear of school sense.  I'd say I learned most of my stuff either on the job,  or even just watching movies and watching what people do.  And talking to people. "
405,0:43:13,0:43:16,SPEAKER 5, You're probably watching a much different way  than I would watch a movie. 
406,0:43:16,0:43:27,SPEAKER 3," Yeah.  I watch them in a very technical way.  When I watch a film, I'm always thinking,  oh, how did they do that angle?  Or there's like a, that VFX was looked a bit weird  or wherever it took about that. "
407,0:43:27,0:43:30,SPEAKER 5," Yeah, yeah, just like, you can't be a nerd about it, yeah. "
408,0:43:30,0:43:41,SPEAKER 3," But yeah, basically.  And once you've seen the other side,  you can't kind of ignore it, which sometimes is annoying,  because you can't just like get involved with the movie.  Yeah. "
409,0:43:41,0:43:48,SPEAKER 2," You start thinking about it.  I'm the same.  I watch Moist Critical, and I'm like,  what's the angle he's spinning?  What's the title?  And how does that really put, he's saying, "
410,0:43:48,0:43:49,SPEAKER 1, how does he make a lot of use of it? 
411,0:43:49,0:44:10,SPEAKER 4," It's really happening for me.  No, I think that's, people say that a lot  because I do this thing where I analyze jokes  because I'm a psychopath, and I like to break things down.  But I have reconciled in my brain  that breaking something down and enjoying it  are two like isolated experiences.  Like doesn't ruin everything if you just know how it works  and it's like, no, because they're both fun. "
412,0:44:10,0:44:11,SPEAKER 3," I've got it, I've got a joke for you. "
413,0:44:11,0:44:12,SPEAKER 1, Please. 
414,0:44:12,0:44:15,SPEAKER 3, What do you call a man with no shins? 
415,0:44:19,0:44:21,SPEAKER 4," A gushineless, a shineless man. "
416,0:44:21,0:44:25,SPEAKER 1," Tony.  Oh, Tony?  What? "
417,0:44:25,0:44:26,SPEAKER 4, I don't get it. 
418,0:44:26,0:44:28,SPEAKER 1," Because it goes to Tony and me and the media, to Tony and me. "
419,0:44:28,0:44:34,SPEAKER 4," Come on, guys.  Is that, wait, did you say that because that's  a form of my name? "
420,0:44:34,0:44:36,SPEAKER 1, No. 
421,0:44:36,0:44:37,SPEAKER 4, You could have said yes. 
422,0:44:37,0:44:38,SPEAKER 1, You could have said yes. 
423,0:44:38,0:44:39,SPEAKER 3, I'm an honest guy. 
424,0:44:39,0:44:40,SPEAKER 2, I appreciate the honesty. 
425,0:44:40,0:44:44,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, that was a, he could have said yes,  and then kicked you in your shins. "
426,0:44:44,0:44:45,SPEAKER 5, That's right. 
427,0:44:45,0:44:47,SPEAKER 1, That's how I'm going to create a song with me down. 
428,0:44:47,0:44:50,SPEAKER 2," You guessed it right.  And he's like, yep, that's a great bit. "
429,0:44:50,0:44:55,SPEAKER 5," Have you ever told that joke to anyone  and had them just fucking erupt?  They're not like, they're like, you're the man. "
430,0:44:55,0:44:57,SPEAKER 3," No, but I find it hilarious. "
431,0:44:57,0:45:01,SPEAKER 2," That was Jason Mamo, Golden Globes, 30 minutes.  He's almost throwing up. "
432,0:45:01,0:45:30,SPEAKER 1," He just couldn't stop, yeah.  Do you?  So I imagine when you decide now, like if you  want to work on a project, you get the final sign off.  I'm like, whether or not you want to do it, like that,  I would guess.  Yeah, yeah.  When, but when you start when you're a kid  and you're getting these roles as like a younger person,  who is making that decision for you?  Like, does that come like pretty early or like,  when did the change happen?  Like, this is like, I don't know,  my guardian, my agent, making that decision versus you  making the decision, like, how does that happen? "
433,0:45:30,0:45:44,SPEAKER 3," I mean, at the end of the day, it's always kind of my choice  even when I was a kid.  Yeah.  But when you're that age, kind of rely on either my agent  or my mom to kind of guide me in my choices.  Yeah.  Because as a 10 year old, you don't, you don't know what good "
434,0:45:44,0:45:45,SPEAKER 2, for you. 
435,0:45:45,0:45:46,SPEAKER 3, You dumb as bricks. 
436,0:45:46,0:45:51,SPEAKER 1," Exactly.  Yeah.  I mean, I imagine his, your mom always  been like pretty supportive.  I would imagine. "
437,0:45:51,0:45:52,SPEAKER 3, Yeah. 
438,0:45:52,0:45:54,SPEAKER 4," Yeah.  No, she has. "
439,0:45:54,0:45:55,SPEAKER 1, Is she lovely? 
440,0:45:56,0:45:58,SPEAKER 2, He meant that in a much way. 
441,0:45:58,0:46:00,SPEAKER 5, That is the British way to ask if your mom's hot. 
442,0:46:00,0:46:03,SPEAKER 4, What the fuck?  I'm just asking you a normal ask question. 
443,0:46:03,0:46:05,SPEAKER 2, Is she nice? 
444,0:46:05,0:46:06,SPEAKER 5," Yeah, but what is he going to say? "
445,0:46:06,0:46:09,SPEAKER 2," Oh, no, she's a garbage can.  I have a little rocking face. "
446,0:46:09,0:46:11,SPEAKER 4, Maybe his relationship with his mom fucking stuff. 
447,0:46:11,0:46:13,SPEAKER 1, Be clear.  I don't know.  I don't care.  I don't care. 
448,0:46:13,0:46:17,SPEAKER 4," I'm afraid.  Oh, you don't care about his mom if she's lovely or not.  I don't care.  I probably love mom. "
449,0:46:17,0:46:23,SPEAKER 1," I don't care if she's lovely.  I'm sure she is.  Oh, for sure.  And you're sure. "
450,0:46:23,0:46:27,SPEAKER 4, So you're just going to infer.  And you're not going to let him tell you whether or not she's 
451,0:46:27,0:46:30,SPEAKER 1, whether or not she's sucks. 
452,0:46:30,0:46:35,SPEAKER 5," Sir, I'll change.  So did your mom suck?  There's a real piece of fucking word. "
453,0:46:35,0:46:35,SPEAKER 3, It's sucked ass. 
454,0:46:35,0:46:38,SPEAKER 1," It's fucked, dude. "
455,0:46:38,0:46:39,SPEAKER 3," No, my mom's sick. "
456,0:46:39,0:46:45,SPEAKER 5," Is there any role that you've had that even now you watch back  and you're just like, oh, it's like hard to watch? "
457,0:46:45,0:46:47,SPEAKER 3," Yes.  Do you have a specific role?  I mean, pretty much all my roles, I hate watching. "
458,0:46:47,0:46:48,SPEAKER 5, Really? 
459,0:46:48,0:46:49,SPEAKER 4, We're actually the same. 
460,0:46:49,0:46:52,SPEAKER 5," Is there one that's above the rest?  Fuck, I wish I didn't do that. "
461,0:46:52,0:46:53,SPEAKER 3, Yes. 
462,0:46:53,0:46:54,SPEAKER 5, Which one is that? 
463,0:46:54,0:46:56,SPEAKER 1, Are you not going to say it? 
464,0:46:56,0:46:59,SPEAKER 3, I don't know if I could say this.  I've got a few. 
465,0:46:59,0:47:02,SPEAKER 5," What can you say it in a few, do you say it?  And then we'll censor it. "
466,0:47:02,0:47:06,SPEAKER 1, Hold on.  He doesn't feel that way.  Wait. 
467,0:47:06,0:47:07,SPEAKER 4," I just said, let's just talk about that. "
468,0:47:07,0:47:08,SPEAKER 3, I've been told that before. 
469,0:47:08,0:47:09,SPEAKER 1, All right. 
470,0:47:09,0:47:12,SPEAKER 2, What if you just start by basically when I get an ender's game? 
471,0:47:12,0:47:21,SPEAKER 1," Boy, what if you listed the roles from your favorite  to least favorite?  Let's start with the favorite. "
472,0:47:21,0:47:22,SPEAKER 2, Which director sucks? 
473,0:47:22,0:47:24,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
474,0:47:24,0:47:26,SPEAKER 3," Go say easy.  Oh, I'm fucking what you got. "
475,0:47:26,0:47:34,SPEAKER 5," Were you ever approached to do a Disney Channel  original movie?  No.  Did you have a child actor?  What, they've been around for a while. "
476,0:47:34,0:47:35,SPEAKER 4, No. 
477,0:47:35,0:47:37,SPEAKER 5, They didn't exist.  What are you saying?

551,0:51:17,0:51:30,SPEAKER 3," No, so there's this whole thing  and I don't know if it's Scottish or British,  but you'll convince them that Haggis is like a thing.  It's like if you Google Haggis,  you come out, it comes out of this little guinea pig  like creature obviously isn't fucking real.  But, um, if you told me about this, "
552,0:51:30,0:51:35,SPEAKER 5," when I met you, I would just, I believed you.  I'd be like, oh, Haggis, yeah,  sounds like a British animal. "

569,0:52:09,0:52:12,SPEAKER 2, I mostly know this from super out of beds. 
570,0:52:12,0:52:14,SPEAKER 1," Oh, wow.  Fire, shit, bro. "
571,0:52:14,0:52:15,SPEAKER 3, Honey badger.

616,0:54:01,0:54:03,SPEAKER 4, That's the heckler in the crowd. 
617,0:54:03,0:54:19,SPEAKER 2," I went to the bathroom and then Jake in Pat went to the bathroom  and they're like talking about wow.  And then I had just in passing something about runescape  because it was free to play.  And they just fucking laughed at me.  Like, you know, wow.  Like, no, I can't get the membership.  And they just laughed. "
618,0:54:19,0:54:20,SPEAKER 1, And they walked out. 
619,0:54:20,0:54:21,SPEAKER 5, I straight up got bullied. 
620,0:54:21,0:54:22,SPEAKER 3," Did you have a runescape membership, though? "
621,0:54:22,0:54:23,SPEAKER 1, No. 
622,0:54:23,0:54:44,SPEAKER 2," No, my mom was expressly against it.  Not until I put it on like a Christmas wish list  and I printed it out.  And I posted a picture of a, it was the MMO called Dophis.  And I was like, Dophis membership.  And it was six bucks.  And that's all I wanted for Christmas.  And she got it for me.  I was like, fuck yeah.  And then the next month, I was like,  I got away 11 months for a new membership. "
623,0:54:44,0:54:45,SPEAKER 4, You got one month? 
624,0:54:45,0:54:48,SPEAKER 1," Yeah.  And that's so funny.  Yeah, I got booms. "
625,0:54:48,0:54:50,SPEAKER 4, And you said I shouldn't know your mom. 
626,0:54:50,0:54:55,SPEAKER 2, My mom's great.  But she just didn't support me eating McDonald's  or playing video games. 
627,0:54:55,0:54:58,SPEAKER 4," You know, the spucked up one, it's called Tibia. "
628,0:54:58,0:54:59,SPEAKER 3, I got her birthday. 
629,0:54:59,0:55:11,SPEAKER 4," The bone, that's a bone.  No, I got there.  Tibia was like this free to play MMO that like,  it was just, it was like a browser game.  But that's what you played if you didn't know about runes.  But there's levels of sewer. "
630,0:55:11,0:55:14,SPEAKER 2," All right, let's get to it.  Boris Johnson in her house. "
631,0:55:14,0:55:20,SPEAKER 4," You couldn't even get through it, bro.  Why is that so funny to you? "
632,0:55:20,0:55:25,SPEAKER 2," Because it's just like, it's like such a political question  to be like asking an actor in America,  like who they vote for. "
633,0:55:25,0:55:27,SPEAKER 1," It's just such a, okay, sure.  Yeah. "
634,0:55:27,0:55:29,SPEAKER 4, Don't Boris Johnson in your house. 
635,0:55:29,0:55:30,SPEAKER 3," You know, yeah, fuck Boris. "
636,0:55:30,0:55:36,SPEAKER 4," Hey, I don't know much.  I just pretty much know he's like,  your guys is Trump, but he's like more. "
637,0:55:36,0:55:38,SPEAKER 3, He's a fucking clown. 
638,0:55:38,0:55:46,SPEAKER 2," He's a bit of a clown.  He threw a lot of parties during COVID and lied.  Well, making everyone sit under lock down. "
639,0:55:46,0:55:50,SPEAKER 3," He seemed like all the videos of him,  like rugby tackle and kids in a football game. "
640,0:55:50,0:55:55,SPEAKER 1," No, no, no, I would like them if I sold on.  Hold on, do I like this guy now? "
641,0:55:55,0:55:59,SPEAKER 5," This guy, it sounds like this is this is this is pretty. "
642,0:55:59,0:56:14,SPEAKER 3," This is before he would have like ascended to whatever.  And it's like he was he was known for being a clown.  He's the mayor of London.  And he just fucking did stupid shit.  And people kind of let him get away with it.  Because he was like, oh, he's kind of funny.  He's like fine around.  And now he's a prime minister. "
643,0:56:14,0:56:16,SPEAKER 5, It sounds like you had Steve O's a mayor. 
644,0:56:16,0:56:27,SPEAKER 1," So this is like, this is my perspective on him  getting elected as prime minister.  Wait, is that the video?  It's like you spin it.  He was a few seconds of it, tackling the kids. "
645,0:56:27,0:56:35,SPEAKER 2," I would just, I would just like a few seconds of it  just to see him tackle some kids.  It almost feels like he wanted to do like a,  how many seven year olds could I beat up in a fight challenge? "
646,0:56:35,0:56:38,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, but he made it real.  And he made it real, which we've all wanted to do. "
647,0:56:38,0:56:40,SPEAKER 2, How many kids can I beat the mayor of London? 
648,0:56:40,0:56:45,SPEAKER 1," It's been more like this, it's been more like this, it's been more like this.  Yeah, how many kids can I beat? "
649,0:56:45,0:56:46,SPEAKER 2, He's got a good voice. 
650,0:56:46,0:56:48,SPEAKER 1, Is it not loading? 
651,0:56:48,0:56:50,SPEAKER 2," All right, we're getting involved.  We're getting involved watching us. "
652,0:56:50,0:56:51,SPEAKER 4, We're watching us. 
653,0:56:51,0:57:03,SPEAKER 1," Oh, my God.  He's just a dude, he murdered that guy.  It's so fucking funny.  Yeah, he's a dude, he put his shoulder into it.  He wanted to hurt the kids. "
654,0:57:03,0:57:04,SPEAKER 2, So why is he not the greatest prime minister ever? 
655,0:57:05,0:57:09,SPEAKER 4," Then he takes his hand.  Oh my God, I can't believe he shook his hand.  Well done. "
656,0:57:09,0:57:15,SPEAKER 3," And that's not the first time he did it.  He did this charity football game and he did the same thing.  Wasn't too a kid, but it's a habit. "
657,0:57:15,0:57:17,SPEAKER 2, Can I say I think that's cool? 
658,0:57:17,0:57:18,SPEAKER 4, It's nice. 
659,0:57:18,0:57:19,SPEAKER 2, I think that's a cool thing he's ever done. 
660,0:57:19,0:57:30,SPEAKER 4," It sucks, right?  Because if, like, we're, if roles were reversed  and we're telling a bunch of British people  that like, Trump did a really funny Ghostbusters review once.  And they're like, oh, well, I mean, he's the Ghostbusters funny. "
661,0:57:30,0:57:35,SPEAKER 2," I listen to the daily.  I know about BJ, he blows.  And, but that's, that's the best thing. "
662,0:57:35,0:57:38,SPEAKER 5," Really, you're gonna say that.  You're gonna say, I know about BJ, he blows. "
663,0:57:38,0:57:39,SPEAKER 1, I know about BJ. 
664,0:57:39,0:57:42,SPEAKER 2," That's crazy.  I just, I threw it out there.  I just, I just called BJ. "
665,0:57:42,0:57:45,SPEAKER 4," Can I, do you listen to the daily? "
666,0:57:45,0:57:45,SPEAKER 3, Of course. 
667,0:57:45,0:57:46,SPEAKER 1, No. 
668,0:57:46,0:57:52,SPEAKER 4," Okay.  This context won't hit you very hard,  but I want to get Ludwig's, like, take on my impression. "
669,0:57:52,0:57:53,SPEAKER 2, Michael Barbarra? 
670,0:57:53,0:57:53,SPEAKER 1," Oh, yeah. "
671,0:57:53,0:58:01,SPEAKER 4," Yeah.  Oh, this news show.  And the guy talks, he just basically like summarizes  that whatever the guest is saying, like a fucking child. "
672,0:58:01,0:58:04,SPEAKER 1," Michael, if you watch the yard,  just talk like a normal guy.  Okay. "
673,0:58:04,0:58:16,SPEAKER 4," No, we do it.  So, you're saying that the Biden administration,  they're putting gummy bears in Putin's asshole.  And that the gummy bears are gonna be a problem. "
674,0:58:16,0:58:17,SPEAKER 1, Are you cranked? 
675,0:58:17,0:58:20,SPEAKER 4," And then be like, yeah, that's exactly right, Michael.  That's what I said. "
676,0:58:20,0:58:24,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, this is a perfect impression.  But also, I think it's good that he does this. "
677,0:58:24,0:58:26,SPEAKER 4," No, I don't fucking think it's good that he does that. "
678,0:58:26,0:58:33,SPEAKER 1," No, the person, that that's the problem.  The person will say all of that  and then Michael repeats it back word for word. "
679,0:58:33,0:58:35,SPEAKER 5," Well, they can just half the time of the show. "
680,0:58:35,0:58:47,SPEAKER 2," Occasionally, he challenges them in that rephrasing.  So he'll rephrase it in a way that's like a broader stroke.  Because they'll use very specific words and he'll be like,  so you're saying that Ukraine sucks.  It'll say it's a phrase like that  and they'll be like, well, not exactly, Michael. "
681,0:58:47,0:58:55,SPEAKER 1," I think it's something about the cadence.  I think it's something about the cadence  because the show is great.  I'll feel informed, but just it's something about the cadence. "
682,0:58:55,0:58:57,SPEAKER 2, It's like I'm talking back to Borussia. 
683,0:58:57,0:58:58,SPEAKER 4, You need to get that out. 
684,0:58:58,0:59:01,SPEAKER 5," Okay, my question.  Have you seen a single episode of our show? "
685,0:59:01,0:59:07,SPEAKER 3, I watched Bits.  I watched Bits.  I knew before we reached out. 
686,0:59:07,0:59:08,SPEAKER 1," No, okay, that's fair. "
687,0:59:08,0:59:11,SPEAKER 2," Yo, can I ask a question?  Why did you do this? "
688,0:59:12,0:59:13,SPEAKER 3, Why did I do this? 
689,0:59:13,0:59:14,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
690,0:59:14,0:59:16,SPEAKER 3, There's nothing better to do. 
691,0:59:16,0:59:16,SPEAKER 5," Yeah, fair enough. "
692,0:59:16,0:59:17,SPEAKER 4, That's great. 
693,0:59:17,0:59:21,SPEAKER 2," If you've got like a L'Oreal commercial,  you're like, busy fellows. "
694,0:59:21,0:59:22,SPEAKER 1, I'm busy. 
695,0:59:22,0:59:24,SPEAKER 4, I gotta advertise the one for the kids  that is a little fishboss. 
696,0:59:24,0:59:25,SPEAKER 2, No tears. 
697,0:59:25,0:59:26,SPEAKER 5, I'm serious. 
698,0:59:28,0:59:30,SPEAKER 2," Well, that's great.  I'm glad that you had nothing better to do. "
699,0:59:30,0:59:33,SPEAKER 4," What do you think when you watch some clips?  You're like, is this fine? "
700,0:59:33,0:59:41,SPEAKER 3," I just look like a group of guys just chant shit,  which kind of like what I do once in a time. "
701,0:59:41,0:59:44,SPEAKER 2," The American Dream.  All right, walk me through games you're playing right now. "
702,0:59:44,0:59:45,SPEAKER 1, Gamer check. 
703,0:59:45,0:59:48,SPEAKER 3," Dota, but I've kind of always played Dota. "
704,0:59:48,0:59:49,SPEAKER 2, Dota too? 
705,0:59:49,0:59:49,SPEAKER 4, Yeah. 
706,0:59:49,0:59:50,SPEAKER 1, Did you play Warcraft 3? 
707,0:59:50,0:59:52,SPEAKER 3," I did, not Dota, but I did play Warcraft 3. "
708,0:59:52,0:59:53,SPEAKER 4, Okay. 
709,0:59:54,0:59:55,SPEAKER 3, I didn't play like old stars. 
710,0:59:55,0:59:57,SPEAKER 2, Was it in the background like shocking? 
711,0:59:57,0:59:58,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
712,0:59:58,1:00:02,SPEAKER 4," Dota.  Who's your like a little Dota talk real quick, real quick? "
713,1:00:02,1:00:03,SPEAKER 3, You're on. 
714,1:00:03,1:00:05,SPEAKER 4, Who did you play?  Shadafi Mid? 
715,1:00:05,1:00:06,SPEAKER 1, You're on the support. 
716,1:00:06,1:00:09,SPEAKER 3, I only put it in my play.  What are you trying to do? 
717,1:00:09,1:00:10,SPEAKER 4, What does it mean?  I'm just saying you're very supportive. 
718,1:00:10,1:00:12,SPEAKER 2, Are you saying he looks weak? 
719,1:00:12,1:00:14,SPEAKER 5," Yeah, you look like a beta male to get past that. "
720,1:00:14,1:00:15,SPEAKER 3, Do you think I can't carry? 
721,1:00:15,1:00:16,SPEAKER 4, I think you can carry. 
722,1:00:16,1:00:28,SPEAKER 3," I don't play carry.  I don't support.  I play mid.  I play mag mid.  Okay.  Well, I play like sort of initiates and kind of. "
723,1:00:28,1:00:29,SPEAKER 4, You go for the big place. 
724,1:00:29,1:00:30,SPEAKER 3, I go for the big place. 
725,1:00:30,1:00:30,SPEAKER 5, You go for the high real. 
726,1:00:30,1:00:32,SPEAKER 3," I go for the big place.  Yeah, exactly. "
727,1:00:32,1:00:34,SPEAKER 2, That's my rank check. 
728,1:00:34,1:00:35,SPEAKER 3, I don't play ranked. 
729,1:00:35,1:00:38,SPEAKER 4," Oh, neither does zipper conversation. "
730,1:00:38,1:00:42,SPEAKER 3, I don't like solo queue.  That's fair.  That just sounds depressing. 
731,1:00:42,1:00:42,SPEAKER 1, Usually with friends. 
732,1:00:42,1:00:45,SPEAKER 3, I don't know.  I've got quite a few people I play with. 
733,1:00:45,1:01:02,SPEAKER 2," I think that's actually the most healthy thing you could do  because you know, Valorant, I played with that.  I only play with friends and he, and he, both solo queue.  And I only know this because I hear, what are you doing there? "
734,1:01:02,1:01:03,SPEAKER 4, What do you mean? 
735,1:01:03,1:01:04,SPEAKER 1, Slaming the table. 
736,1:01:04,1:01:08,SPEAKER 2, I like 3 a.m.  And it's absurd and it's bad for your health. 
737,1:01:08,1:01:14,SPEAKER 1," No, I stopped solo queueing and you have to quit like cigarettes.  Yeah. "
738,1:01:14,1:01:25,SPEAKER 3," I now I just thought anxiety and it's also playing stock up was because I would, I'll just  get so.  Yeah.  I'd feel like shit playing a game.  I'll be so stressed.  Yeah.  I was like, this isn't good for me. "
739,1:01:25,1:01:26,SPEAKER 1, What starcraft did you play? 
740,1:01:26,1:01:27,SPEAKER 3, Two. 
741,1:01:27,1:01:30,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.  I guess it's like either starcraft.  You're still fucking sick. 
742,1:01:30,1:01:31,SPEAKER 4, Yeah. 
743,1:01:31,1:01:33,SPEAKER 3, I wasn't very good.  I played third. 
744,1:01:33,1:01:34,SPEAKER 1, How did you know? 
745,1:01:34,1:01:36,SPEAKER 4, I'm just on.  I'm just on right now. 
746,1:01:36,1:01:41,SPEAKER 1, You also just have a 30% chance of getting that correct.  Like it's a decent on. 
747,1:01:41,1:01:44,SPEAKER 4," Claiming he plays support, that's a one in five. "
748,1:01:44,1:01:45,SPEAKER 2, You're also wrong. 
749,1:01:45,1:01:46,SPEAKER 4, No. 
750,1:01:46,1:01:48,SPEAKER 2, He said he plays support.  I thought he said mid. 
751,1:01:48,1:01:52,SPEAKER 3," Well, I play, I play a bit of both mid.  I play like two or three or four. "
752,1:01:52,1:01:53,SPEAKER 1, He gave it to you. 
753,1:01:53,1:01:55,SPEAKER 3, He did.  Which one of those roles is a support? 
754,1:01:55,1:02:20,SPEAKER 1," I also, so I also had a dota, a dota question or a dota related question because that's  what was my understanding of like your, of your perspective on competitive gaming is you  play smash and you play dota because we've seen you, like you know Blitz, right?  And I think you hung out with Blitz and the liquid guys.  If you had to pick one, like if you had to stick with one competitive game for the rest  of your life, I imagine it's between those two.  What would you play? "
755,1:02:20,1:02:28,SPEAKER 3," As in, well, don't, or I don't obviously smash up, compete it in, but don't, I'm not  nearly good enough to play competitively. "
756,1:02:28,1:02:36,SPEAKER 1," I guess if you had to really answer your question, if you had to leave one behind and only  play one for the rest of my life, yeah, you're on out. "
757,1:02:36,1:02:43,SPEAKER 4," Oh, it's smash, no, you know, you know, I just don't know forever, no, it's not smash "
758,1:02:43,1:02:51,SPEAKER 2," because he's an ultimate player.  So the fucking moment that come out of the new game, you throw away ultimate to the side and  you go, I don't want to play with you anymore, like Andy from Toy Story. "
759,1:02:51,1:02:59,SPEAKER 3," Yeah.  I feel like Dota is there's a special place in my heart, but Dota, and if I said anything  other than that, I'd be lying. "
760,1:02:59,1:03:01,SPEAKER 4, It doesn't.  It doesn't leave. 
761,1:03:01,1:03:02,SPEAKER 1, You hear that team? 
762,1:03:02,1:03:03,SPEAKER 2, You hear that? 
763,1:03:03,1:03:06,SPEAKER 1," That's your sign player.  Dude, they have a Dota team.  They have a Dota team. "
764,1:03:06,1:03:08,SPEAKER 4, That's it.  That's our girl. 
765,1:03:08,1:03:11,SPEAKER 1, He hangs it.  He hangs it.  He hangs it. 
766,1:03:11,1:03:14,SPEAKER 5," Also, I think with Dota coach, I think your dumb is fucked to, by the way, it's not filled  in there. "
767,1:03:14,1:03:15,SPEAKER 4, Anyway. 
768,1:03:15,1:03:19,SPEAKER 2, Jesus Christ.  You're smoking weed or meth? 
769,1:03:19,1:03:37,SPEAKER 4," Dota, I will say, it gets in your bones.  I've played it since the beta game.  I played it in Warcraft 3.  And you're just like, I haven't played probably in a two years, but I'm like, I could  play it again.  Like it's never going to, it's never going to go away.  I do feel however.  I'm like, damn, those thousands of hours, what if I did something else?  Hmm.  What if I? "
770,1:03:37,1:03:39,SPEAKER 1, Do you?  Yeah. 
771,1:03:39,1:03:59,SPEAKER 4," I do.  I lost 12 game.  I've told this on the podcast for the lowest gaming moment I ever had.  It was 12 games straight all day playing of conquer mid because I watch things saying  a lot.  No one would be cool.  Lost every single one for 12 in a row.  And I was like, this is the worst it's ever going to be for my life.  It was my worst gaming moment in my life. "
772,1:03:59,1:04:00,SPEAKER 5, Yeah. 
773,1:04:00,1:04:01,SPEAKER 1, It was life moment. 
774,1:04:01,1:04:02,SPEAKER 2, Maybe. 
775,1:04:02,1:04:04,SPEAKER 1, You get a redo.  What do you think he's doing? 
776,1:04:04,1:04:08,SPEAKER 3, He's not.  He's done his stuff playing.  I don't know.  I remember I played with him. 
777,1:04:08,1:04:10,SPEAKER 4, One.  Yeah. 
778,1:04:10,1:04:11,SPEAKER 1, I haven't followed. 
779,1:04:11,1:04:14,SPEAKER 3, I miss him in Yapas.  I remember his team.  That was nine. 
780,1:04:14,1:04:16,SPEAKER 4, He's on mouse.  I think way early. 
781,1:04:16,1:04:17,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
782,1:04:17,1:04:18,SPEAKER 4, Yeah. 
783,1:04:18,1:04:21,SPEAKER 3, That was a good time.  And people hopping around teams.  I'm totally like crazy. 
784,1:04:21,1:04:25,SPEAKER 2, So I'm 1200 hour do over.  What do you do?  What do you learn right now? 
785,1:04:25,1:04:26,SPEAKER 4, What do you have? 
786,1:04:26,1:04:28,SPEAKER 1," I think like 4,000 hours. "
787,1:04:28,1:04:30,SPEAKER 2, What skill do you have with those hours?  What do you port into? 
788,1:04:30,1:04:32,SPEAKER 4, I don't know. 
789,1:04:32,1:04:33,SPEAKER 1, Guitar. 
790,1:04:33,1:04:34,SPEAKER 3, Do you play instrument? 
791,1:04:34,1:04:42,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, I play instrument.  But I'm, you know, I wish I spent more time.  You're not like me yet, Aisa.  You're not bald. "
792,1:04:42,1:04:43,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
793,1:04:43,1:04:48,SPEAKER 4, You got time.  You'll find out soon enough what you want to do. 
794,1:04:48,1:04:49,SPEAKER 5," Because if he shaved his head, he would make that work. "
795,1:04:49,1:04:51,SPEAKER 1, I can tell. 
796,1:04:51,1:04:51,SPEAKER 3, I've shaved my head before. 
797,1:04:51,1:04:55,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.  Head to the bone.  I think I've seen you with the shoulder. 
798,1:04:55,1:04:59,SPEAKER 3, It was like a 0.5.  So technically no. 
799,1:04:59,1:05:00,SPEAKER 4, How'd you feel? 
800,1:05:00,1:05:03,SPEAKER 3, Pretty sick.  I felt like fucking hot as nails.  Really? 
801,1:05:03,1:05:04,SPEAKER 1, Do you have a good head? 
802,1:05:04,1:05:05,SPEAKER 3, Apparently I do. 
803,1:05:05,1:05:08,SPEAKER 2, Mine's bad.  Because I have weird bumps. 
804,1:05:08,1:05:10,SPEAKER 3, You don't know until you shave it. 
805,1:05:10,1:05:14,SPEAKER 2, And I also have a rash on the back of my head where I got born. 
806,1:05:14,1:05:15,SPEAKER 3, Oh yeah. 
807,1:05:15,1:05:16,SPEAKER 1, Where you what? 
808,1:05:16,1:05:24,SPEAKER 2," Where I got born.  Like when I, when I popped out, I think where I got born.  The doctor scraped it herself and I don't know who hatched from. "
809,1:05:24,1:05:26,SPEAKER 3," Still, that's like 20 something. "
810,1:05:26,1:05:29,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, it's just like a birthmark, I think, for life.  It's just like a little red. "
811,1:05:29,1:05:30,SPEAKER 3, Yeah. 
812,1:05:30,1:05:32,SPEAKER 2, Don't laugh at my birth effects. 
813,1:05:32,1:05:45,SPEAKER 4," Big question.  You can only answer you don't have to.  But he's, he speaks French.  We all hate it in, in the house.  Do you have any feelings about the French as a, as a Londoner? "
814,1:05:45,1:05:48,SPEAKER 3, Do I have any feelings about the French like someone? 
815,1:05:48,1:05:51,SPEAKER 5," Would you make, would you make one blanket statement about every French person? "
816,1:05:51,1:05:53,SPEAKER 2, Would you make love to a French person? 
817,1:05:53,1:05:54,SPEAKER 1, Gone to hell. 
818,1:05:54,1:05:59,SPEAKER 3," Which question would I answer, maybe?  No, go ahead, pick your favorite. "
819,1:05:59,1:06:00,SPEAKER 1, I don't mind. 
820,1:06:00,1:06:02,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, the French are cool.  I got some French friends. "
821,1:06:02,1:06:03,SPEAKER 4," It's so cool, man. "
822,1:06:03,1:06:06,SPEAKER 2," The beef's a bit, I feel like it's cap.  I feel like it's an older person. "
823,1:06:06,1:06:07,SPEAKER 4," Beef's cap, yeah. "
824,1:06:07,1:06:08,SPEAKER 2, French versus English. 
825,1:06:08,1:06:10,SPEAKER 3, Paris.  I'd say is overrated. 
826,1:06:10,1:06:11,SPEAKER 1, Sure. 
827,1:06:11,1:06:14,SPEAKER 5, Everyone I've never met who has been there said it was overrated. 
828,1:06:14,1:06:24,SPEAKER 2," It's also the largest tourist destination in the world.  And I don't think it should be.  But I called my mom and I told her I was going to London and she was like, watch out.  She said that.  She was like, they don't like French people. "
829,1:06:24,1:06:25,SPEAKER 1," And I'm like, first of all, really? "
830,1:06:25,1:06:30,SPEAKER 2," You can't tell.  I'm American.  I'm not walking around going like, oh, Bojou. "
831,1:06:30,1:06:33,SPEAKER 1," I'm like, the idea of your mom is just like, they can sense it in your blood. "
832,1:06:33,1:06:34,SPEAKER 2, Yeah. 
833,1:06:34,1:06:35,SPEAKER 3, But Ludwig's not an American name. 
834,1:06:35,1:06:36,SPEAKER 1, It's German. 
835,1:06:36,1:06:42,SPEAKER 3," Right.  And they were just like, I'm saying that Asa's not an English name either.  What is that?  It's Hebrew. "
836,1:06:42,1:06:43,SPEAKER 1," Oh, wow. "
837,1:06:43,1:06:44,SPEAKER 3, Are you Jewish? 
838,1:06:44,1:06:55,SPEAKER 4, I'm not Jewish.  I knew in Asa in my school and my podunk redneck town.  His name was Asa.  And then he became the manager of a casino.  So you're in good company. 
839,1:06:55,1:06:56,SPEAKER 1, Okay. 
840,1:06:56,1:06:58,SPEAKER 3," There's two Asas.  There's also a porn star, cool, Asa. "
841,1:06:58,1:06:59,SPEAKER 4, Wow. 
842,1:06:59,1:07:00,SPEAKER 2," Oh, wait. "
843,1:07:00,1:07:19,SPEAKER 1," Asa Akira.  You know.  Yeah.  He's like, he's like, you know how I told you before the pod, I'm like, I followed  Amaranth on Twitter because I just couldn't, I look.  It's just too much. "
844,1:07:19,1:07:22,SPEAKER 5, Yeah.  It turns public scrolling of Twitter into a fucking way. 
845,1:07:22,1:07:30,SPEAKER 1," You can't do it.  My, my keep all this time, she was like one of the first hundred people I followed.  Asa Akira.  You kept?  Yeah. "
846,1:07:30,1:07:31,SPEAKER 2, She's still on there. 
847,1:07:31,1:07:35,SPEAKER 1, Why did you not follow it?  She only tweets like once a month.  It's fine. 
848,1:07:35,1:07:36,SPEAKER 2, It's political. 
849,1:07:36,1:07:37,SPEAKER 1, I'm ready. 
850,1:07:37,1:07:40,SPEAKER 4, I'm down the hedge.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
851,1:07:40,1:07:44,SPEAKER 5," You know what, Kaelin?  I still follow you.  So porn star twitters are pretty funny.  Like right now, like Lisa Anne's Twitter, it looks like she's a real estate agent. "
852,1:07:44,1:07:52,SPEAKER 4," They do look.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're like, take a picture.  And it's like, they're like, name and stuff.  And it's just like, no one's lawyer or something.  But I'm not shut. "
853,1:07:52,1:07:53,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
854,1:07:53,1:07:58,SPEAKER 4," Which why not?  You know, I think that's a good, we have this lawyer in LA called sweet James. "
855,1:07:58,1:08:04,SPEAKER 5, You know about sweet James?  I don't know.  You can't compare it to anything here. 
856,1:08:04,1:08:23,SPEAKER 4," Do you have like so in LA, you drive down the highway, the highways.  And there's lawyers that advertise themselves on billboards, usually injury attorneys.  And it's sort of considered, there's like a flying for its like ambulance chaser, because  they're always just trying to get a piece of like some sort of settlement.  Is there a sort of like analog to that in the UK? "
857,1:08:23,1:08:28,SPEAKER 3, Not so much.  I know what you're talking about.  I've seen those like those places on the highways.  I don't know if we do. 
858,1:08:28,1:08:29,SPEAKER 4, Yeah. 
859,1:08:29,1:08:34,SPEAKER 3, It's not so like blatantly like cash grab. 
860,1:08:34,1:08:40,SPEAKER 4," Do you think there's this level of subtlety here that doesn't let that happen?  Or is there like, I guess Boris Johnson, your fucking prime minister? "
861,1:08:40,1:08:47,SPEAKER 1, So I don't know.  I don't know.  I feel like the having the NHS probably prevents that market from appearing. 
862,1:08:47,1:08:51,SPEAKER 4, What does hockey have to do with any of this? 
863,1:08:51,1:08:58,SPEAKER 2," It's not the NHS in America.  Like, when you think it's national hockey service, and they, and they, and they, and they "
864,1:08:58,1:09:08,SPEAKER 1," raise, and everybody has their register, you could be drafted at any time.  I didn't change the version of the fucking, fucking get a, I get a piece of mail from Sidney  Crosby. "
865,1:09:08,1:09:10,SPEAKER 5, It was just like come join the original question. 
866,1:09:10,1:09:11,SPEAKER 1, We just forget it. 
867,1:09:11,1:09:13,SPEAKER 2," Well, I mean, it was the analog too. "
868,1:09:13,1:09:15,SPEAKER 5," No, no, no, no, we're talking about sweet James. "
869,1:09:15,1:09:26,SPEAKER 4," Yeah.  Sweet James.  Sweet James is a fucking billboard lawyer.  And like, it's so funny because he's just, he has like radio commercials in L.A.,  where he's just like, gotta call sweet James.  And you're like. "
870,1:09:26,1:09:27,SPEAKER 5, Lovely. 
871,1:09:27,1:09:28,SPEAKER 4, I'm in practice. 
872,1:09:28,1:09:29,SPEAKER 2, Why don't we make a billboard? 
873,1:09:29,1:09:32,SPEAKER 3," That's what you should have spent.  And we're at 4,000 hours doing it.  Really? "
874,1:09:32,1:09:33,SPEAKER 4," Billboard lawyer, parody song. "
875,1:09:33,1:09:34,SPEAKER 2," No, singing. "
876,1:09:34,1:09:36,SPEAKER 3, Yeah.  Doing little jingles for sweet James. 
877,1:09:36,1:09:37,SPEAKER 2, You could be somewhere. 
878,1:09:37,1:09:39,SPEAKER 5," Oh, too.  We could meet our old talk after. "
879,1:09:39,1:09:40,SPEAKER 1, Why don't we make a billboard? 
880,1:09:40,1:09:41,SPEAKER 2, That's like shop. 
881,1:09:41,1:09:43,SPEAKER 3, Do you guys have a jingle for this show? 
882,1:09:43,1:09:44,SPEAKER 2, Why don't we make a billboard? 
883,1:09:44,1:09:45,SPEAKER 1, We do. 
884,1:09:45,1:09:46,SPEAKER 3, You guys singing? 
885,1:09:46,1:09:47,SPEAKER 5," No, no. "
886,1:09:47,1:09:48,SPEAKER 2," No, piano riff. "
887,1:09:48,1:09:49,SPEAKER 4, It's a written piece. 
888,1:09:49,1:09:51,SPEAKER 5, Have you seen a trailer park boys? 
889,1:09:51,1:09:52,SPEAKER 3, Bits. 
890,1:09:52,1:09:56,SPEAKER 5, Have you seen?  It's always sunny.  Bits.  Similar to the intros of both shows. 
891,1:09:56,1:09:57,SPEAKER 2, There's some regrets. 
892,1:09:57,1:10:03,SPEAKER 4," Oddly juxtaposed as elegant, you know.  And then the craftness comes in.  That's the idea. "
893,1:10:03,1:10:05,SPEAKER 1, Okay.  Yeah. 
894,1:10:05,1:10:13,SPEAKER 2, Yeah.  It is a sweet tune.  Yeah.  Let's go back to it.  Yeah.  I want to make a billboard with you.  It's me and you were both in suits.  It's in LA. 
895,1:10:13,1:10:14,SPEAKER 1, And it says it says. 
896,1:10:14,1:10:15,SPEAKER 2, Did you get sucked off? 
897,1:10:15,1:10:17,SPEAKER 1, And there's a phone number.  No. 
898,1:10:17,1:10:18,SPEAKER 4, Okay. 
899,1:10:18,1:10:28,SPEAKER 5, So it's it's did Boris Johnson check your kid.  And then it's it's you it's you and him like this.  Like looking at the camera.  And it's like call now.  Yeah.  You only handle cases. 
900,1:10:28,1:10:31,SPEAKER 2, He's tackling me.  And then it's a billboard.  Throw up and like right outside London. 
901,1:10:31,1:10:35,SPEAKER 3, Like the day cleaning service.  Like it's guys on it. 
902,1:10:35,1:10:36,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
903,1:10:36,1:10:41,SPEAKER 4, It's the day cleaning plus injury attorney.  Like all in one one stop shop. 
904,1:10:41,1:10:52,SPEAKER 1," This could be good in your you know whenever you're not on a shoot.  Like kind of in your off season right now.  You could you could just be setting up the days in people's homes in Los Angeles.  Dude, you're really selling me this. "
905,1:10:52,1:11:10,SPEAKER 2," You should make a billboard.  I daily dose had this idea.  He wanted to have a street of billboards somewhere in America.  And he asked like 15 youtubers.  I put in a group chat.  It's like laser beam and Mr. Beast and daily dose of internet.  He's like, everyone wants to do a billboard.  Everyone's like, what the fuck is this idea? "
906,1:11:10,1:11:11,SPEAKER 1, They all leave. 
907,1:11:11,1:11:14,SPEAKER 2, It dies.  But I've been attached to it ever since. 
908,1:11:14,1:11:16,SPEAKER 4, Do you know hammered this? 
909,1:11:16,1:11:17,SPEAKER 1, No. 
910,1:11:17,1:11:21,SPEAKER 2, I'm going to show you a picture real quick. 
911,1:11:21,1:11:25,SPEAKER 3, I know from the guys you guys have done stuff with her. 
912,1:11:25,1:11:26,SPEAKER 5," Oh, yeah. "
913,1:11:26,1:11:34,SPEAKER 4," She's on her show.  She's great.  She's probably the biggest bitch streamer.  Well, not the biggest switcher.  She's the biggest I think. "
914,1:11:34,1:11:38,SPEAKER 2, Probably in terms of hours watched because she streams about 250 hours a month. 
915,1:11:38,1:11:39,SPEAKER 1, She's live so often. 
916,1:11:39,1:11:41,SPEAKER 2, Yeah.  She's in no case like that. 
917,1:11:41,1:11:43,SPEAKER 1, Do you watch any streamers or youtubers? 
918,1:11:43,1:11:46,SPEAKER 3, Not really.  Like most of the streams I watch are for like competitive. 
919,1:11:46,1:11:48,SPEAKER 2, You just try to get cracked at games. 
920,1:11:48,1:11:49,SPEAKER 3, Like for tournaments. 
921,1:11:49,1:11:50,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, basically. "
922,1:11:50,1:11:51,SPEAKER 5, Maybe I can fall? 
923,1:11:51,1:11:52,SPEAKER 3, Daily dose. 
924,1:11:52,1:11:53,SPEAKER 1, Daily dose! 
925,1:11:53,1:11:55,SPEAKER 3, Daily dose fucking quality.

927,1:11:56,1:11:57,SPEAKER 5, You know that. 
928,1:11:57,1:12:00,SPEAKER 3, I just need to go straight. 
929,1:12:00,1:12:02,SPEAKER 2, But you don't like watch that regularly that you would. 
930,1:12:02,1:12:03,SPEAKER 1, Outside of. 
931,1:12:03,1:12:06,SPEAKER 3, Dailies on the daily.

937,1:12:15,1:12:16,SPEAKER 2, You seem like you would be a summoning salt fan. 
938,1:12:16,1:12:19,SPEAKER 3, I didn't like this sometime.  Yeah. 
939,1:12:19,1:13:07,SPEAKER 2," I haven't seen it. Yeah, he did punch out.

It's perfect react content  Like you watch any of these guys on stream and chats just love in every second of it  But yeah, they're all go to documentaries. I'm trying to think of other people in that same field  But I think that's that's it shockingly several of those people are in an secret online poker group  Really do you know about this? No, there's an online poker group tears. Use a part of it. You're just leaking "
940,1:13:07,1:13:14,SPEAKER 4," That's not like they can't like get into it. Yeah, it's fine. Is it is it high stakes?  520 it is "
941,1:13:14,1:13:51,SPEAKER 2," It's like a like a couple hundred dollar buy-in. I played one day  Worst experience in my life. They hop on a discord call they play on this app  It's just kind of weird. It's like swipe up to like, you know, fold like shake to call  Weirdly interactive. Yeah, it poker for the week. It's like a weegame  Poker now and I'm in it. It's switching. Yeah, and it's and it's me. It's mr. Beast. It's tearsoo. It's the CEO of carrot  Okay, it's like this one guy who runs it and we're and we're playing and there's a couple of other youtubers in there as well  And and mr. Beast went in 15 hands in a row "
942,1:13:53,1:13:56,SPEAKER 4, All in for like that's so he's Duke V trody for like a so annoying 
943,1:13:56,1:14:11,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, like and and I am like you know  I I ran an online poker ring for a while allegedly, okay  I know a little allegedly so I'm waiting for some Primos  You know, I get my ace Kings and I get it in and I beat him and he just instantly buys in for like a thousand "
944,1:14:12,1:14:17,SPEAKER 5, He's got infinite money again. He can just kind of do that forever. And so it's like it's like the the whole entire day 
945,1:14:17,1:15:07,SPEAKER 2," I'm there. I'm like I'm like playing and eventually I get it all in again. I have another bright hand  It's like something like jacks and he's like six three and he just gets a straight and I'm like this isn't  He's just trying to be on anymore. Yeah, because this is just anxiety for me and all he's doing while he's playing is on the  Discord going  Monopoly laughing at me while just like just maybe robbing someone with like 5% chance of winning  Yeah, and it's and this is his pleasure. That's that you never played again  They owe me $500 cuz I ended up winning but I never cash it in cuz I never wanted to go back in because I didn't want to get sucked  Back into the hell hole  But anyway tears who's in that he's sucked in that he's sucked in that demon monster his tears you dog at poker  What no, he's really good because like he's a fucking nerd. Yeah, right? He's like you know John boy actually  John boys in there. No, no, I'm just saying I said that cuz tears is inspired by him in a way "
946,1:15:08,1:15:21,SPEAKER 3, You can't erase it. I play poker. I'm not like good but you play but you're okay  But you don't like have this like this hole in your heart. I've not got a gambling addiction  That's what you're trying to do. Are there casinos in London? 
947,1:15:22,1:15:24,SPEAKER 4, We've gone we went in stoke 
948,1:15:24,1:15:28,SPEAKER 5," Oh, they want to quit. They had single zero roulette there, right? Yeah "
949,1:15:28,1:15:39,SPEAKER 3," I think possibly the first time I went to casino was after the ESL Birmingham do a major  Yeah, the off-the-party accident. Oh, it's dangerous. That was dangerous "
950,1:15:40,1:15:51,SPEAKER 2," Cuz you're all getting drunk. It was it was a it was a heavy night forever, right? Yeah, it's a little degenerate here  Cuz I went to a gas station and it's kind of like Vegas and they just had slots. Yeah here "

Yeah, college here is like two years you take off to school  But you finish it when you're 18, but it's in a different place. It's not high school. You did secondary than college "
972,1:18:51,1:18:56,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, you to do any practice. Did you finish it all was it? Yeah, I like I "

976,1:19:11,1:19:28,SPEAKER 3," As in like yeah, I had less of it  Well, I guess like at school where it was everyone just like oh, you're the actor kid. I was I was lucky not so much  Obviously, people were interested, especially people like in younger years. Mm-hmm. Mostly it was the teachers actually that would suck up to me  It's quite funny. Oh, it's the kids. That's a better "
977,1:19:28,1:19:40,SPEAKER 2," No, ten year olds watching boy in the striped jama that's like such a hard film. They did really like people studied it in school  It's not ten year olds like they studied it. That's why interest. I actually did watching in school, too "
978,1:19:40,1:19:48,SPEAKER 3," Did it about it. Thank God that would have been  Fucking weird. That would have made it more complicated. Yeah, that would have I think they saw that as being potentially "
979,1:19:48,1:19:54,SPEAKER 1, It would have been good for you in a brief circumstance where you could just like walk on that assignment  Like what are you gonna you gonna make me write? 
980,1:19:56,1:19:59,SPEAKER 2, They're good. They give them an after like no you're wrong. You call the director 
981,1:20:00,1:20:05,SPEAKER 5, It's like a partner assignment. Everyone's like well. I'll be with that guy. I remember hearing when 
982,1:20:06,1:20:15,SPEAKER 4, Your name Emma Watson she like went to brown because she got into brown which is great school  And she would like answer questions in class and people be like yeah three points for Gryffindor 
983,1:20:15,1:20:17,SPEAKER 1, Yeah 
984,1:20:17,1:20:21,SPEAKER 4, She's fucking quit. She didn't want to finish get roll 
985,1:20:23,1:20:25,SPEAKER 1, It's funny like one time you know 
986,1:20:26,1:20:31,SPEAKER 3," I know a lot of actors who like decided to just be on school. Yeah, school is kind of it felt like you "
987,1:20:32,1:20:37,SPEAKER 2, And maybe I'm wrong here lived a pretty normal life. I did even though you were a famous actor 
988,1:20:37,1:21:12,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, I think I was lucky how um  I think because I started young and I like or  The industry I didn't want to be a part of  In kind of  particular parts of Hollywood and I just enjoyed being in London  I think being in London you're just slightly separate from like  The machine and like it's just turning out all of these like did you have opportunities with the Hollywood?  Do you mean in the sense of not being in Hollywood? Yeah, yeah, I think Hollywood's massively destructive  I think just being away from that and also just having like my family and my friends who are all pretty "
989,1:21:13,1:21:18,SPEAKER 2," The boy and Jill do you ever turn down big roles because you you were like oh, that'll make me too big time "
990,1:21:19,1:21:21,SPEAKER 1, That'll be too big as a kid 
991,1:21:21,1:21:25,SPEAKER 3, I thought turned down a role it would be because of like the quality of the Gryffindor shit. You like turned out shit stuff 
992,1:21:26,1:21:32,SPEAKER 4, The blood wig bio pick he's not gonna  You would would you would you play me? I would write it 
993,1:21:32,1:21:36,SPEAKER 5, But I wouldn't write it for asa you wouldn't do it you would play you'd play me in your bio pick 
994,1:21:38,1:21:40,SPEAKER 4, So funny 
995,1:21:40,1:21:42,SPEAKER 5, We're way worse than we're looking than you might do 
996,1:21:44,1:22:13,SPEAKER 4, This is one little dick one liner. I do think it's like a it's like a you it's or I guess make it like a British actor thing  I feel like every child actor that comes that's not from America  They just end up having like better more well-rounded lives  And then the child stars from from the U.S. are just like it gets bad. They hit coke by 14 heroin by 16  Not even the like the music industry like Aaron Carter  He was fucked up man. There's like a whole thing about how his life just got really really weird. They've fought relationships with their family 
997,1:22:14,1:22:23,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, it's always like a terrible path  But you are just like a normal guy who happens it feels like a job for you rather than like you are an actor like my life "
998,1:22:23,1:22:24,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, yeah "
999,1:22:24,1:22:32,SPEAKER 3, I'm not like being in school like when I was a kid like it was nice to you're like  15 16 you woke me that also day. It's nice to just like hang out with people you're on age. Yeah 
1000,1:22:33,1:22:43,SPEAKER 4, Like grow up with normal humans. You got bloods like from way back or like where your friend goes  I met you know pretty much all these guys in the past like five years. I said I got my childhood friends 
1001,1:22:44,1:22:48,SPEAKER 3," A lot of my close friends are still like my friends from school. Yeah. Yeah, this is the same area. Yeah "
1002,1:22:48,1:23:00,SPEAKER 4," You're born like fucking down the street. Yeah, that's really nice  You're life rules  But not in the way that's like oh, you're actor man. What sucks. See? Huh? What sucks in your life? What sucks in my life? "
1003,1:23:00,1:23:05,SPEAKER 5," Fucking life right now. Oh, dude. I can't complain. You can't just get all you get dark with me right now dark. Oh, you're crazy "
1004,1:23:06,1:23:08,SPEAKER 2, What are the dark thoughts? 
1005,1:23:08,1:23:13,SPEAKER 5, We can bring back the therapy session. This is where it's going. What are your phrase? What's the hardest you've ever cried? 
1006,1:23:14,1:23:19,SPEAKER 3," Holy shit  Um, not much "

1008,1:23:25,1:23:30,SPEAKER 5, I'm gonna suck you can't like use Tinder at crackly I guess because everyone's just like I like it 
1009,1:23:32,1:23:38,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, uh, it has done in the past like it has its benefits and it has its real drawbacks "
1010,1:23:38,1:23:49,SPEAKER 2," I could imagine it suck if you like hooked up with someone and like like let's just say you bust fast  And then they start telling people like oh dude, what is it? You want to what's up bro? "
1011,1:23:49,1:23:51,SPEAKER 5, Something you want to talk like if you happen to come quickly 
1012,1:23:51,1:24:07,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, if you happen if you have to be someone. I don't know if you happen to happen.

1019,1:24:32,1:24:41,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, I look here's the thing. I don't have any  I forgot I lost my train of thought and I didn't want to keep talking about four skin out of respect "
1020,1:24:41,1:24:49,SPEAKER 5," Okay, see when when aces agency asked me to send over a list of things we'd ask  This is kind of wise. Oh, there's there's rules. Okay "
1021,1:24:51,1:24:54,SPEAKER 1, How deep can we get we're gonna ask him whether he's cut or uncut 
1022,1:24:55,1:24:59,SPEAKER 2," That's chill, right? That has to chill. Oh, okay, tummy involved "

1030,1:25:42,1:25:53,SPEAKER 2, But could you not I actually was thinking about this could you not just be like mr. agent  I want to look like Ryan Reynolds does now and they'd be like okay  And then you just do the thing where you take steroids or whatever 
1031,1:25:54,1:26:05,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, but that's off of my own back like I don't want to be the one making that cool  I want to have like Marvel cool me out be like  Like the model diet here's your personal trainer his your nutritionist try not to think about it "
1032,1:26:05,1:26:16,SPEAKER 2, You want to be like British boy wonder and then I'm like great. I'm like I'm now I feel fit. Is that something you want to do?  Like would you throw that onto the universe and be like agent be like give me a roll that just gonna be fucking hot like

1034,1:26:22,1:26:37,SPEAKER 2," Right yes, because everyone's looking to do it and it's like you get an acting gig and you get to look hot after it's still work  There's a lot of work. That's like the main way the the analog for youtubers is doing a boxing match to get ripped "
1035,1:26:38,1:26:41,SPEAKER 4," It's got to pay off somehow. Yeah. Yeah, I like like there's a couple homes. You're "
1036,1:26:42,1:26:53,SPEAKER 2," If you don't know what you're doing it. I I have a dream. I don't want to wind up doing a chess boxing match  But I think I'm too much of a pussy to do it. So I'll just host it and commentate it. Yeah, fair enough "
1037,1:26:53,1:26:57,SPEAKER 4, Because I don't I it's scary. Do you want to do chess boxing for a shit? Would you chess? 
1038,1:26:57,1:26:59,SPEAKER 3, What is the boxing come into this? 
1039,1:26:59,1:27:10,SPEAKER 5, So you play you play chess like around a chess and then like a timer goes off for every switch you take you switch over  And you get one five the goal you either win by checkmate or knockout. It's it's all it ever happens first 
1040,1:27:10,1:27:21,SPEAKER 2," So it's like two minutes of chess two minutes of boxing back to chess back to boxing and this is the thing you know, it's a real  real story that already existed before me from the ages and and you progressively get way worse at chess "
1041,1:27:23,1:27:27,SPEAKER 1," Because you're getting taking concussions, uh, and so I want to get no better "
1042,1:27:27,1:27:29,SPEAKER 5, Boxing 
1043,1:27:29,1:27:31,SPEAKER 1, Imagine 
1044,1:27:31,1:27:36,SPEAKER 4, Imagine you do some sort of bishop move  But the boxing version I've been offered because 
1045,1:27:38,1:28:08,SPEAKER 2," Idubs you know him the youtuber. I do he's trying to run a boxing event  But he was gonna box rice coming he backed out and Idubs now fucking just like huge  Like he's been doing it for like six months eight months like he's just been training  And so he's like dude my rage. He's literally just going around like like door to door asking any youtubers like please fight me  Like please like getting the fucking ring with me. And so like I got hit up and I'm like no  Eight months deep. You're trained. You're ripped. This is my tummy. Yeah, it's true "
1046,1:28:08,1:28:12,SPEAKER 5," What I got is how I'm a panic scar and a dream dude. Yeah, in a chest "
1047,1:28:12,1:28:14,SPEAKER 2, I think if I get punched in my chest while I die 
1048,1:28:16,1:28:20,SPEAKER 4, I don't have enough bone to protect you. I believe that the heart is like an inch away 
1049,1:28:20,1:28:26,SPEAKER 2, And it's just like not you're good like you give an extra beat so you should be able to wear like a little like maybe fill it 
1050,1:28:27,1:29:27,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, it's sort of yeah, yeah, sort of cup  Yeah  Yeah, and then it'll keep you safe. Yeah, maybe that's what I'll do. I had a dream last night  I'm not kidding that me and Nick went into some English person's house  And we started like I spilled something and she got really mad at me  And we're like in her house like this is normal, but it's not it's a dream  Build something she gets insanely furious at me and and I start cleaning up and I'm like I'm sorry  She's like stupid Americans, and I'm like oh, I'm sorry and then I get mad and I'm like here's some money  Because that's what you all care about  And so I take money and like that's what you care about so just take the money then  All this sudden she like screams outside  Hey, come on and get him and there's like six lab and now they're chasing us  For like the whole dream and we're running away trying to hide from like these british hooligans that are trying to kill us  We disrespected like their mom "
1051,1:29:28,1:29:58,SPEAKER 1," Is it is the end of the stream like that one video with those like three shirtless British lads hitting each other over the back with  lawn chairs. Have you seen that?  He their shirt. No, they're definitely British. They're in like the back patio of ours. They're all shirtless  They're all pretty fucking jacked and the guys just like  Hit me with it and his friend pulls up a chair that he folds up  And he just he bends over  Takes a massive hit of his cigarette. Here we go "
1052,1:29:59,1:30:00,SPEAKER 4, All right over the back legendary 
1053,1:30:00,1:30:12,SPEAKER 2, It is one of the greatest videos I think on the internet. It's a fucking amazing video  And they just take the drag. I love how the kiss before because it demasculates the whole thing 
1054,1:30:12,1:30:15,SPEAKER 5, She just puts this video on still makes it so hard 
1055,1:30:16,1:30:24,SPEAKER 2," You gotta you gotta wake up. This is so funny. Yeah. Yeah. He lines it up and  It's it's it's a minute, but it goes hard "
1056,1:30:25,1:30:30,SPEAKER 3," In the beneath he's him in the ass. Yeah, so this guy gets it like this guy gets it fine "
1057,1:30:30,1:30:33,SPEAKER 2, And and I'm gonna skip ahead here. It's it's he goes back 
1058,1:30:36,1:30:39,SPEAKER 1, I love what he's like a leg again. I love it 
1059,1:30:40,1:30:42,SPEAKER 2, And then it gets sad for a ballman 
1060,1:30:42,1:30:44,SPEAKER 1, Oh 
1061,1:30:44,1:30:49,SPEAKER 4," When do they kiss? Oh you miss it. It's at the way beginning. Yeah, the first second of it right here "
1062,1:30:51,1:30:53,SPEAKER 3, It's so sweet. That makes it okay. It's really sweet 
1063,1:30:54,1:31:10,SPEAKER 2," It makes it sweet if they didn't kiss. It's like a weird video  British people, but now you're like I'm a British people  So lovely. Yeah, it is lovely, isn't it?  Uh, okay, the recommendation for me as a British man  I've been seeing a lot of posters. Okay, is this cringe? I want to go to a play "
1064,1:31:11,1:31:16,SPEAKER 4, It's cringe in the in the wrong context. It's cringe because you think it is. It's cringe 
1065,1:31:16,1:31:22,SPEAKER 1," It's cringe because you want to do it here specifically. I feel like if we were in New York, you wouldn't do this "
1066,1:31:22,1:31:50,SPEAKER 2," I think I might but why why do you want to see a play like living? We live in LA  You would never do this. I feel like unlike LA. I've been hit with so many ads  For laym is for they did we do love it. I say we I know it goes to the fear. Do you never go? No, not really  Have you never done theater acting? No, not something. You're really no. I like the cameras. Wow  Yeah, I thought about it, but it's not for me. Are there like actors who look down on you for that? "
1067,1:31:51,1:31:53,SPEAKER 3, Maybe camera guy 
1068,1:31:53,1:32:04,SPEAKER 5, You like the like the bow Burnham of Actors. He like didn't go to comedy school. I just like  It went directly from YouTube video to comedy special to movie 
1069,1:32:05,1:32:12,SPEAKER 3," You're like that. That's that's a huge compliment. Thank you very much. Yeah, yeah, but we're on a religion compared to yeah, I'm not saying as an insult "
1070,1:32:13,1:32:19,SPEAKER 4," Thing is the thing is the theater is so beautiful. Hey, I have an English degree. Yep degree. No, sir "
1071,1:32:20,1:32:24,SPEAKER 5," Well, listen up take some notes boy. Do I have a lot to teach you right now? "
1072,1:32:25,1:32:31,SPEAKER 4, I'd just say I will say I was like I want to ask a sub about Shakespeare because I'm such a I didn't like Shakespeare in school 
1073,1:32:31,1:32:36,SPEAKER 3," You didn't no, that's crazy. I feel like maybe I would actually I've chained up my house really not "
1074,1:32:36,1:32:46,SPEAKER 4," I mean, maybe you like had to be forced to sit down and read it. You're like, oh, okay. That's kind of cool  But it's like we live in the era where you can play video games instead and that's beautiful. I just finished God of war "
1075,1:32:47,1:32:53,SPEAKER 3," Literally boy, it's fucking good. It's the best like single-player game I've played in a while "
1076,1:32:54,1:33:03,SPEAKER 2," Also, it's a great ending you played it. I've only watched it  Guilty pleasure. I watched soda pop and play it and I watched for about 24 hours straight because he did "
1077,1:33:03,1:33:06,SPEAKER 5, This is the thing where he plays it straight through holy shit. I can't watch anyone play games that long 
1078,1:33:07,1:33:16,SPEAKER 2," Well, I fucked up this month because I have to stream a certain amount of hours on YouTube  And I've streamed maybe 20 so far in the months almost over. Oh my god. So I have to do a 24-hour stream of Eldon Ring when I get back "
1079,1:33:16,1:33:18,SPEAKER 4, That's hype 
1080,1:33:18,1:33:27,SPEAKER 3, You souls guy. Do you like souls asa? I'm not very I've played bits. I played Sekiro  Which I actually really enjoyed but I'm not I wouldn't call myself a souls guy 
1081,1:33:27,1:33:34,SPEAKER 4," I called Dark Souls one the wire of video games. Does that does that make sense to you? I mean, I've seen parts of the wire "
1082,1:33:34,1:33:43,SPEAKER 3," But your comparison goes over my head  Maybe played psycho nuts. No, I feel like I'm going on the game parts "
1083,1:33:44,1:33:47,SPEAKER 5," Yeah, it's a game for sure. Yeah. Oh the second one. Yeah, yeah "
1084,1:33:48,1:33:54,SPEAKER 2, My favorite game. Just play super on the pets pro. It's all you need. Oh my god. All right. We're at 90 and I'm full of piss and I have to go to the trough 
1085,1:33:55,1:34:14,SPEAKER 1," Wait, before we wrap up actually I actually did have a last question for you  Yeah, what's up? So we were just talking about like the way you got an acting and the it wasn't long. I did a bit of acting  Yeah, you did smash some stuff. Yeah, I put a lot of great acting. Yeah, I'm a good actor  You were you didn't have an educational background in acting either. I'm the best actor in the gaming world "
1086,1:34:15,1:34:20,SPEAKER 2, Outside of well-neff and like 30 other people but  Tough list. You go ahead um 
1087,1:34:20,1:34:56,SPEAKER 1, Because because you don't like come from the like I guess like a traditional background in acting like you and you start so young and you figure out  All these things by yourself like when you prepare for a role because I I feel like there's all these stories of like you know  Daniel day Lewis like lives is the character for like months or like  Heath Ledger like spent the month in the hotel room before he became  Like the Joker on dark night. Do how do you prepare for how do you generally prepare for a role  And is it like different between roles like do you pick a specific way every time or do you like how have you figured that out um 
1088,1:34:57,1:35:20,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, it's kind of different depending on the role some roles need more  Work and like kind of like workshopping and figuring out. I'm not a method actor by any means like  I would never put myself through that  Yeah, that seems like insane even in the world of acting. Yeah, I've never felt that necessary  Um, and also I play a lot of the roles I play feel quite familiar to me  So I feel like I can kind of just be a version of myself "
1089,1:35:21,1:35:24,SPEAKER 1, When you when you queue up for like a new season and you're gonna be Otis again 
1090,1:35:24,1:35:37,SPEAKER 3," Like do you just like yeah, I'm gonna be and you just slip it up. Yeah, that's like when you've been doing something that long you can kind of just  Go into it. Yeah, I can just easy  Dude, oh shit. Don't make me don't make me say that "
1091,1:35:38,1:35:47,SPEAKER 2, Don't make me say that. I just like got a war go downstairs and you're like I have sex  Two million sir 
1092,1:35:49,1:35:53,SPEAKER 3, They literally tell me what to say really they write it down. It's all on a page. I all have to do is 
1093,1:35:54,1:35:58,SPEAKER 2," Dude, it's so he just shows up reads a script. Yeah, you should try to be a streamer for you "
1094,1:35:59,1:36:01,SPEAKER 3, I've tried streaming have you yeah 
1095,1:36:02,1:36:03,SPEAKER 4," And you didn't like it. You know, I didn't like well "
1096,1:36:04,1:36:10,SPEAKER 3," When I play games, I feel like I'm always tri-harding  And I find it hard to try hard and talk and be entertaining. Yeah, that's why I don't like it "
1097,1:36:10,1:36:14,SPEAKER 5, My problem with streaming is I want to win and winning becomes harder when you're streaming. Yeah 
1098,1:36:15,1:36:20,SPEAKER 2, Gaming should become secondary to the entertainment of the people who are watching and you should not care about gaming 
1099,1:36:20,1:36:36,SPEAKER 4, Is my take on it? You know pissing me off. Let me would you just said because all right stuff  We were I write ads for him for stuff and like I'm the writer guy and he says it and you never look  You never give a shit and you're like I always win it and they really have to do in 30 takes  And I write it down for you
