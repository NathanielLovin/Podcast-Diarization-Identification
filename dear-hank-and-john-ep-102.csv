0,0:00:00,0:00:07,SPEAKER 2, Hello and welcome to Dear Hank and John. 
1,0:00:07,0:00:09,SPEAKER 1, Of course I've heard of the good Dear John and Hank. 
2,0:00:09,0:00:18,SPEAKER 2," It's a comedy podcast where me and my brother John, we answer your questions, give you  to be a advice and bring you all the week's news from both Mars and AFC Wimbledon, hey John "
3,0:00:18,0:01:03,SPEAKER 1, how you doing?  Hank we're both very tired.  I know that we're often tired when we record the pod but like right now I've been tired  for a few months and turtles all the way down is finally it's like I'm in the last  hours of it belonging to me you know like in like I don't know like 200 hours or so or  maybe 150 hours it will never belong to me ever again and it's belong to me for like  six years so I have chosen to spend these last several hundred hours with turtles all  the way down a wake and there are times when I have regretted that decision but I also  can't seem to make any other decision.  How are you? 
4,0:01:03,0:01:13,SPEAKER 2, I'm good you know I feel bad that I haven't read your book because you sent it to me about  a week ago and I still haven't read it but I do hope that you understand that I can't  do anything. 
5,0:01:13,0:01:20,SPEAKER 1, Yeah the candle is burning at both ends and it will not last the night but. 
6,0:01:20,0:01:27,SPEAKER 2, Could you have a candle and you split off the middle part into like a third end and light  that one too? 
7,0:01:27,0:01:35,SPEAKER 1, I believe that would actually give you four ends and if so Hank would immediately light  all four of them because that's the kind of person he is. 
8,0:01:35,0:01:48,SPEAKER 2, No I've actually made my candle into like the weapon from the movie crawl and it spins  really fast so it's extra oxygenated so all five ends can burn really fast. 
9,0:01:48,0:01:59,SPEAKER 1, Is that a movie I'm just I'm never I'm not familiar with the movie but is it a movie  in which the krill that blue whales eat to turn evil?  No.  That's disappointing. 
10,0:01:59,0:02:15,SPEAKER 2, No in fact I couldn't I can't even tell you very anything about the movie crawl I just  remember I watched it when I was a child on television and I was so in love it's just  it's I was it was the best thing it was and I should probably watch it again so I know 
11,0:02:15,0:02:34,SPEAKER 1, how bad it is but I really liked it.  Well no hurry on on reading my new book but quicker reminder to our listeners they can  read it on October 10th and get assigned copy to by going to probably signed turtles.com.  The number one website on the internet right now it's blowing up one of one of the things 
12,0:02:34,0:02:42,SPEAKER 2," I did this weekend that I actually quite enjoyed was was hankler fishing almost 5,000 pieces  of paper. "
13,0:02:42,0:02:43,SPEAKER 1, 3000. 
14,0:02:43,0:02:58,SPEAKER 2, Oh almost 3000 oh jeez god wow there's you do what you do in this a lot I did not I did  not finish I've not done yet but I'm like two thirds of the way done and it's not an insignificant 
15,0:02:58,0:03:04,SPEAKER 1, task John.  No and that's only I will remind you one and a half percent of the total signatures. 
16,0:03:04,0:03:07,SPEAKER 2, So I feel I feel bad for only doing one and a half percent now. 
17,0:03:07,0:03:11,SPEAKER 1, Well I also feel bad I wanted to send you a second box but you said no. 
18,0:03:11,0:03:35,SPEAKER 2, I know I feel bad but that doesn't mean that here's the thing that you gotta know just  because you feel bad doesn't mean you have to do something like I can I can I can feel  guilt and be like I it's really too bad that I'm not doing this thing and I feel bad  that I'm not doing it but also I'm not going to because I feel better about not having  to do that thing. 
19,0:03:35,0:04:05,SPEAKER 1, Alright hank that's actually a pretty good transition to our first question.  We're skipping the short poem because I read I I recited half of that at the St. Vincent  Millais poem so we're good on the short poem front we're moving on.  Okay.  This question comes from Matt and it involves you know something that's that's difficult  that you might or might not do.  Dear John and Hank what is the largest terrestrial animal you would feel comfortable fighting  in hand-to-hand combat like lies what is the smallest terrestrial animal you think would  best you?  Art Varks and Armadillos Matt. 
20,0:04:05,0:04:09,SPEAKER 2, John I think that there are times when my cat could take me. 
21,0:04:09,0:04:36,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.  I mean I actually I was thinking that as well Hank like there's a there's a coyote in  my backyard.  I mean it's not really a backyard there's a coyote in the forest behind my house and I see  it sometimes and it probably weighs like 30 pounds and I see it and I think we both know  that if you're hungry I'm dead.  You could totally take a coyote I mean I think I know I couldn't I think like I'd have 
22,0:04:36,0:04:51,SPEAKER 2, a hard time like like fighting and winning against a porcupine right because like what  am I going to do like where am I going to punch you how am I going to strangle a porcupine  like I might be able to get away without any trouble but I don't feel like I'm going 
23,0:04:51,0:05:02,SPEAKER 1, to win.  Similarly I don't think I could kill a skunk.  I think the smell would overpower me I would use consciousness and the skunk would slowly  eat me over the course of three days. 
24,0:05:02,0:05:15,SPEAKER 2, So John the definitely the largest terrestrial animal I could kill yeah it's probably a tortoise  like a Galapagos tortoise I would just hold it and preventing it from preventing it from  getting food. 
25,0:05:15,0:05:17,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.  I don't know. 
26,0:05:17,0:05:21,SPEAKER 2, You could hold it they weigh like 400 pounds but like there's a number of sizes it would 
27,0:05:21,0:05:35,SPEAKER 1, maybe a juvenile I feel like you and a Galapagos tortoise you'd probably win but it would  take like 14 days of hand-to-hand combat before winner was finally declared you know what  I mean. 
28,0:05:35,0:06:27,SPEAKER 2, John I'm in an armadillo recently yeah a three-banded armadillo they can fully enroll meaning  they can become 100% ball and they just roll down a hill.  One of the few animals that can do that I think maybe the only vertebrate and what I  found out is that in addition to being able to fully enroll this the three-browned armadillo  will close almost all the way and leave a little gap intentionally so that a predator will  put its nose into that little gap to try and get it and then it closes all the way and it  totally will like like like basically bite but with its armor plates the nose of the of the  predator which is and this happened to my friend Jesse who runs animal wonders and takes  care of all these exotic animals and her hand she survived her finger was stuck inside 
29,0:06:27,0:06:39,SPEAKER 1, the armadillo for like a half an hour but she lived she did survive so we could take  an armadillo or at least Jesse could yeah I mean do I have any tools I guess I don't 
30,0:06:39,0:06:46,SPEAKER 2, because then no weapons no punching no or punching but no like baseball bats or anything 
31,0:06:46,0:06:52,SPEAKER 1, it's just what can could you take down a coyote with your arms and I don't think I could 
32,0:06:52,0:07:18,SPEAKER 2, all right John I got another question it's from Katrina who asks dear Hank and John my  suburb job consists of scanning and destroying old files at a law firm during this process I have  to remove all of the staples from documents before I feed them through a scanner I have come to  accumulate many mugs full of used staples the summer is only halfway done so more will be added  to the collection it feels wrong to just throw away all these staples what would you suggest I do 
33,0:07:18,0:07:36,SPEAKER 1, with them sometimes paper cups and fasteners Katrina I mean you definitely have to melt them  down into like bullets or something you've got to melt them down into something awesome well what  is the staple made of well it's actually much more of a Hank question than it is a John question 
34,0:07:36,0:07:48,SPEAKER 2, well John it just so happens that inside of my brain without googling this at all modern staples  for paper staples are made from zinc plated steel wires glued together and bent to form a long 
35,0:07:48,0:08:16,SPEAKER 1, strip of staples so there's that sounds like something that you just already knew and I  not at all like you're currently on the Wikipedia page for staple and then in parentheses fast  because there's more than one kind of staple yeah so staples the store yeah there's presumably  some other kind of staple where's the disambigulation page for staple there are surgical staples there's 
36,0:08:16,0:08:27,SPEAKER 2, the staple right the medieval right of certain German ports to require merchant vessels to unload and  display their goods for sale for a certain period often three days there's the statue of the staple 
37,0:08:28,0:09:27,SPEAKER 1, sure there's there's Vince staples the American rapper born in 1993 yeah there's the famous American politician  king staples who was a republican member of the Wisconsin State Assembly that seems like a very  low bar to have to jump over to get a Wikipedia page and there is of course the Christian post hardcore  band staple because apparently there are Christian post hardcore bands I mean that's actually great  that's great that's wonderful that there is a Christian post hardcore band I wonder if there's  a Christian pre hardcore band oh and of course there's staples Canada which is like staples but it's  in Canada oh oh I thought that was the name of a town but maybe staples just bought oh god that's  a great idea Hank speaking of which we have we finally gotten to a point in our lives where we could  buy winner South Dakota the town that is exactly equidistant between our two homes you know probably 
38,0:09:27,0:09:38,SPEAKER 2, not it's a property value is surprisingly expensive we got it we got to buy that McDonald's we got  to buy the holiday in express and sweets winner and then I'll do they have a holiday in express 
39,0:09:38,0:09:52,SPEAKER 1, they do have a holiday in express wow all right yeah we definitely can't buy that I'm not  trying to buy holiday in expresses okay like that that that is a thriving town if it has a  holiday in express let's get back to this question of the staples yeah so you're gonna get some 
40,0:09:52,0:10:08,SPEAKER 2, zinc and you're gonna get some steel and and zinc is mostly what pennies are made out of so you  could send that off to the penny people and they could make pennies out of it oh yeah that's  a great deal probably probably you get like a third of a penny out of those staples I think that 
41,0:10:08,0:10:27,SPEAKER 1, what you should do is you should freak out the attorneys that you work with I think you should start  spelling stuff out in staples at night when they're at home on their desk and then in the morning  they'll be like why does it say put fifty dollars in the scanner or I will tell your secrets in staples 
42,0:10:27,0:10:35,SPEAKER 2, on my desk right good good good is there is there some kind of like fashion options here that's a 
43,0:10:35,0:10:47,SPEAKER 1, great idea you got to make a chain mail sweater yeah that's it you make the chain mail sweater out  of staples no one will mess with you if you have a chain mail sweater also it will be impossible to 
44,0:10:47,0:10:52,SPEAKER 2, take off because the staples will not loop completely and they will just bind to whatever you're 
45,0:10:52,0:10:58,SPEAKER 1, wearing underneath so further more if you had a chain mail sweater then you could take a coyote 
46,0:10:59,0:11:03,SPEAKER 2, yeah definitely no I think you could take a coyote with or without a chain mail sweater John I 
47,0:11:03,0:11:12,SPEAKER 1, just think that you need to get properly motivated no but I could definitely take a coyote if I  had a chain mail sweater on it for no other reason than it would make me feel super confident I 
48,0:11:13,0:11:35,SPEAKER 2, I feel like it's really nice to hear that they're using some paper cups and fasteners because  of course those can be reused staple is just a one time thing and I you know also when you have  a big stack of documents it's not just like the hand stapler like you like the the swing line that  they got an office space but like this like like it's almost like a staple gun and it's like  shoo gonna go through like it could you could go through you could bind like two pieces of wood 
49,0:11:35,0:12:05,SPEAKER 1, together with that thing I've been using a nail gun recently for a home improvement project  and oh my god like what I mean I am done with hammers it is over between me and hammers  nail guns are amazing I'm sure that like eventually I will nail my finger to a piece of wood  and I will be like maybe hammers aren't so bad after all but right now man I am loving life  with a nail gun let's move on to another question Hank all right I feel like we did a really good 
50,0:12:05,0:12:10,SPEAKER 2, job Katrina the short answer is you're gonna have a couple mugs of staples for the rest of your life 
51,0:12:10,0:13:29,SPEAKER 1, so you're gonna make a chain mail sweater and it's gonna be amazing this question comes from  Sarah who writes to your john and hank why is it that when something is spinning quickly such as a  fan a wheel on a car or a fidget spinner the object itself appears to be spinning in the opposite  direction then it is actually rotating uh vetoed in serta more's ser tesima Sarah I believe that  means life is uncertain death is certain but I'm just guessing john I don't know the answer to  this question I know the answer to this question it's finally happened it's finally happened  there's a question about science that Hank does not know the answer to what which happens all the  time but he's not pretending to know the answer and I do know the answer are you sure that you're not  wrong I'm pretty sure that I'm not wrong okay I know why I know why cameras don't I know I  camera see them go backwards or go and and and slowly yes it is because our eyes are not actually  that dissimilar from cameras it's because the frame rate in our brain is not infinite we see  individual images we do not see motion and then we create motion with our brains and that makes  things weird when they're moving really fast I mean I know I I am surprised that our that our eyes 
52,0:13:29,0:13:35,SPEAKER 2, work that way if they indeed do and I look forward to to to emails from people telling us whether 
53,0:13:35,0:13:40,SPEAKER 1, or not john was right about that one I'm sure I can't wait for the corrections they will be Legion 
54,0:13:42,0:14:06,SPEAKER 2, okay hey how about this one from Emma John who asks do you think a John okay so I may have made  an impulse purchase of 527 glow-in-the-dark stars from amazon they were only three dollars so don't  judge me while gazing up into my homemade galaxy however I couldn't help but wonder how the stars  are able to shine how do things glow in the dark space is vast and mysterious Emma okay so my 
55,0:14:06,0:14:14,SPEAKER 1, theory is that glow-in-the-dark stuff absorbs light and then spits it back out when it's dark 
56,0:14:15,0:14:53,SPEAKER 2, well it spits it back out whether or not it's dark but kind of yes so there so you know like  some some things you look at like some markers or pieces of paper and they like for some reason  there they like seem to be it's not just the color they have they're also like throwing out  a like like more color than you feel like they should or to different or like a different color than  you feel like they should this is especially obvious when you use black light so you have a black  light and you're shining the black light on like a white thing and suddenly it looks like that  thing is glowing there's like way more light coming out of the shirt than there is going into it it 
57,0:14:53,0:14:58,SPEAKER 1, appears right right yes yes I'm familiar with this so what is in fact happening is that there is 
58,0:14:58,0:16:19,SPEAKER 2, light going into that shirt that you can't see and then it's being re-radiated or not radiant I  guess but it's being it's being it's being re it's like it's it's it is absorbed by the atoms  in the shirt and then it is re-emitted in a different wavelength so it goes in electrons do  some magic stuff and then when the electrons do their magic stuff it cut like the photo another  photon comes out and that photon is at a different wavelength that you can see in a similar way  when you have glow in the dark thing the photon go in and then it messes with the electrons and  then the photon comes out but there's a delay it doesn't happen immediately it happens a bunch  and it happens all the time and it happens in sort of a curve from like you know the moment when  you take the light away is the most photons coming out and then slowly as time goes on fewer and fewer  of the electrons are the of the photons come out so that that's basically what's happening  I got a huge I don't know a huge amount about that but but when light hits a thing it can change the  energy level of a photon or of a electron going around the the atom and then when it drops back  down to its old energy level which will eventually happen sometimes immediately and sometimes after 
59,0:16:19,0:17:31,SPEAKER 1, a fair bit of time it will release another photon well that is interesting good glad  I'm so I'm glad I know that it burns out I was basically right all along and also to the extent  that I wasn't right I don't really understand let's move on to this other question from anonymous  who writes hello brothers green my husband and I just found out that we are pregnant  you're pregnant he is  excited he's pleased or yes we're very excited but would like to wait to tell friends and family  until the second trimester when the risk of losing the baby is lower however friends and family  have already been asking us about our plans to have children and some have even asked us  directly if I am pregnant those people should be banned they should not be allowed anymore  I am sure that these questions are well-intentioned but I still find it hard and awkward to respond  no duh yeah signed off anonymous uh this happened to us I don't know if this happened to you  it probably did I probably did it for god's sake I'm sorry if I did this happened to us all the time  because like Sarah wouldn't be drinking wine and people would be like why aren't you drinking wine  are you pregnant and Sarah would be like I don't want to talk about it 
60,0:17:34,0:17:38,SPEAKER 2, it's like well now I either have to lie or tell you the thing that I obviously didn't want to 
61,0:17:38,0:18:10,SPEAKER 1, tell you yeah and you there are there are good reasons why people don't want to talk about  pregnancy in the first trimester and that is or or whenever it shouldn't be up to anybody but you  when you tell people that you're pregnant and who you tell uh and it is super annoying to ask  and it's incredibly invasive and don't ask yeah yeah I mean especially like the thing that 
62,0:18:11,0:19:06,SPEAKER 2, there's uh I mean who so serious note like some people will try very hard and for a very  long time to get pregnant and can't and then you're kind of bringing up a sore subject some  people have you know repeated miscarriages and then you're bringing up that and that's no fun  for them to deal with so in general yeah it's just sort of like it's a it's it's it's  I understand why you want to bring it up and why it's funny and why we why we do it but like  there's also this like it it's kind of like you go there and 90% of the time or 99% of the time  it's like fun and like a cute fun thing that happened uh and even if you are pregnant and you're like  okay fine I'll have to tell you that I'm pregnant and that you you've uncovered my mystery  and it's not that big of a deal but like there's that small percentage chance that it's like a really  like you're bringing up a super sore subject and that maybe we don't like and that they should be 
63,0:19:06,0:19:44,SPEAKER 1, up to that person whether or not they're gonna bring that up so also it's not 90 or 99% of the time  it's way closer to 75% of the time I mean something like a quarter of all pregnancies and  miscarriage so it's just uh there is no reason to bring it up yep as far as I'm concerned that's  that I'm I'm sure I'm a little bit biased in that but yeah your responsibility uh you you  should feel free to lie to those people would be my answer because I think they have put themselves  in the position where they are gonna get lied to yeah and then when you tell them later they won't 
64,0:19:44,0:19:50,SPEAKER 2, be like oh my god you're a terrible person for lying to me you know or if they are you can just 
65,0:19:50,0:19:57,SPEAKER 1, be like well that's strike two you one word one more chance and you're out of the friend bucket 
66,0:19:57,0:20:01,SPEAKER 2, this is the bucket where I keep my friends and you're you're you're leaking out the bottom 
67,0:20:01,0:20:11,SPEAKER 1, my bud hey I think that's a wonderful image that we should use more often I think we should tell people  you're about to leak out of my friend bucket if you don't watch out mister I got a friend bucket 
68,0:20:11,0:20:17,SPEAKER 2, and it's got holes in it uh maybe like what can we do to patch up our friend buckets Jon so 
69,0:20:17,0:20:34,SPEAKER 1, they're not as leaky I feel like actually my friend bucket is not leaky at all I haven't lost a friend  in like a decade now I will say in my early 20s I used to lose a lot of friends uh but I haven't  I haven't like had a friend dump me in years which maybe it's like maybe you got a bucket and 
70,0:20:34,0:20:52,SPEAKER 2, and uh and it's not leaking but you're like sort of going through your life and it's slashing  around a little bit so when you have your bucket super full of friends some are gonna fall out  it's just gonna happen and that's okay but when you're like 37 and you have like two friends left  it's like well maybe I should be a little more careful with this thing and also it's harder for 
71,0:20:52,0:21:04,SPEAKER 1, them to fall out because yeah maybe I mean I think that also might be one of those places where like  the metaphor itself is limited and how far you can take it maybe possibly who knows it could be 
72,0:21:05,0:21:11,SPEAKER 2, it could be but there's a hole in the bucket dear Liza and I've I've only got one friend left 
73,0:21:11,0:21:53,SPEAKER 1, all right let's go to this other question from Renee who writes dear green brothers my best friend  and I shared an apartment while in college and during that time I gave her access to my Netflix  account uh oh somebody's leaking out the bottom of the friend bucket she has now graduated and  while I was happy to let her use the account while we live together I feel like it is time for her to  get her own I pay for Netflix for my whole family myself my three siblings my parents and my  grandmother and having her use the account adds another person to an already limited server she also  uses my profile and fills the queue with shows I have no interest in watching oh come on don't  put stuff in the queue that is one of the worst things I've ever heard in my whole life oh my god 
74,0:21:54,0:22:06,SPEAKER 2, it's not your account you can like it's what like you're being done a tremendous $9 a month  favor $10 a month favor now I'm shivering and you just you're abusing that privilege 
75,0:22:06,0:23:33,SPEAKER 1, Renee you need to drill a hole in that friend I mean you have to if you're using someone else's  Netflix account you have to and by the way I include my own spouse in this like when I watch Netflix  as Sarah I have to be an absolute ghost don't read anything don't queue anything don't list anything  just be as close to a ghost as I can be and that's that's my we're married you know you have  separate Netflix profiles of course we have separate Netflix profiles we don't have identical  interests it says who's watching Netflix the moment you log on to Netflix and I say me or Sarah  or kids and the kids I mean oh my god the things my children watch on Netflix if I have to watch  there's all these Netflix kids shows with no words in them Hank I don't you're not familiar with this  yet but like there's the show Oscars Oasis that I guess is like you know it works in every country  because there's there's no language it's fascinating the stuff that they choose to watch  when they get a hold of Netflix like before we wake up on a Saturday morning but anyway yes  Sarah and I have separate Netflix accounts because we watch different kinds of things okay we have  like when we watch Netflix together we can watch on either person's Netflix account when watching  stuff alone I don't want to have you know my bucket poisoned by all the weird you know crime  procedures that Sarah likes I mean Catherine and I have the exact same interests John I find that 
76,0:23:33,0:23:52,SPEAKER 2, weird indeed we do not and I guess is that is that is that looks confused by us they're like who are  these people that like both House of Cards and the Vicar of Dibbley is the Vicar of Dibbley a real 
77,0:23:52,0:24:57,SPEAKER 1, show yeah oh my god I mean that that show sounds like the best made up show it's like you walk  into the BBC offices you sit down in front of you know the person who makes all the BBC shows you  sit down you look them dead in the eye and you say the Vicar of Dibbley and they just like pull out  a stamp that says yes here is our here is our highest budget $300 go make it you yeah they order  like 250 episodes yeah after you say the Vicar it doesn't even like the Vicar of Dibbley that much  mostly mom likes that show she watches it on our Netflix account oh man anyway point being  Renee obviously you need to have a talk with your best friend about putting things in your Netflix  queue that is I mean it's it's oh it's not cool it's a little like I don't understand when you 
78,0:24:57,0:25:13,SPEAKER 2, were living together why that person had to have access to your Netflix account at all it's just  it's in the TV like did you have does she did she need to watch it on her computer and I guess  so you can watch it like different things and different how man but then you then you're stuck honestly

84,0:27:41,0:27:59,SPEAKER 2, actually seen the program I wanted to pick up piece of media that I liked but didn't love  to be sort of representative of like they're like I don't want to be too all anything so I  this is more of a celebration of sort of liking stuff more than a celebration of this particular

89,0:28:55,0:29:42,SPEAKER 1, it back plays Hank I use back plays so I feel like I can actually talk about it uh well I mean  basically what we have to say is your data is valuable and precarious yeah I used to email myself  at the end of every day the document that I was working on that eventually became turtles all the  way down and then I found out about back plays where for five dollars a month it does that exact  same thing except with all of your files not just with the one file um it backs up pictures  documents uh everything it's five dollars a month it's unlimited backup and uh it is it works  really really well it has a mobile app uh it can restore stuff by email uh it's great yeah 
90,0:29:42,0:30:03,SPEAKER 2, backs up not just documents put music photos videos drawings projects everything you do on your  computer there are a number of things that could happen to your computer John it could get hit by  a meteor it could catch fire your house could catch fire you could leave it I feel like if I  underneath a chair on an airplane like I did and and all those there's some baby pictures that I'll 
91,0:30:03,0:30:24,SPEAKER 1, never get back John back plays I didn't have back plays yep Hank that's because you didn't have  back plays you can go to back plays dot com slash deer John to learn more it's five dollars a  month again unlimited backup back plays dot com slash deer John that is the only uh you are  L that you should use so you want to go to back plays dot com slash deer Hank that's also 
92,0:30:24,0:30:28,SPEAKER 2, available but I'm not gonna fight this one because John actually uses it and I haven't yet but I'm 
93,0:30:28,0:33:54,SPEAKER 1, seriously considering signing up because I freaked myself out you sure Hank Hank when you sign up  please go to back plays dot com slash deer John we'll see what what choice I make you can't wait  I really hope I oh man I really hope you use I really hope you use my URL that would make me so  happy Hank I want to answer another question because I actually feel like I might be able to help  with this one probably not but maybe this question comes from Dina who writes deer John and Hank  I've come to realize I have a major social anxiety disorder and it's really starting to back me  into a corner uh then they talk about uh going to an expensive therapist for six months and feeling  like they weren't making progress and then there are a number of phone calls I have to make an emails  I have to send some are intimidating others are so simple they shouldn't intimidate me but I'm just  avoiding all of it and I know I am and I keep doing and I feel like I'm in such a rut I don't know  if I should see another therapist or if it's just time to grow up I don't know this problem is only  getting worse your dubious advice would be appreciated Dina or possibly Dina I'm not very good  of pronunciations um so this is something that everybody experiences not just people who have  anxiety problems right like Hank you definitely experienced needing to send an email and not being  able to yes in fact I did that all weekend so um in my experience and I want to be clear that I  am not a therapist and I do think that you should see a therapist I think that you should see  somebody who is experienced in helping with this however in my experience avoidance does not  make the problem better uh at least over time it might make you feel better right now but it won't  it will you're right that the problems tend to get worse when avoidance is the main strategy so  here's my strategy like in that email you say some of these emails are so simple they shouldn't  intimidate me what well but they do so it doesn't matter like should or shouldn't like don't  put that values judgment on it let's just send those emails today now actually let's not if you're  driving uh no distracted driving pause the pause pause the pod pull over get out your laptop  get connected to wireless get get on get on the internet Wi-Fi that's on the internet. Yeah get on  that panero Wi-Fi and um and break that task up into what however many little chunks you need to  break it up into in order to get it done because once you start rolling down the hill of getting  things done and stopping avoiding them it like anything it gets easier each time uh and you will  love the feeling of being on the other side of this and you know that uh but the only way to get  on the other side of it is to break it up into tiny little tasks you open the you open your email  program you go to compose you hit reply whatever um and you look at you reread the email to get to  the parts that you need to reply to and then you write the reply and then you send it just break it  up into constituent parts uh and once you start it's going to feel so much better because I think in  my experience anyway it's the avoidance it's the sort of behavioral response to the anxiety  that makes it that I think will make the anxiety better by like not doing the thing that's  scaring me um but often in the medium and long run makes the anxiety worse absolutely the case for me um 
94,0:33:54,0:34:25,SPEAKER 2, I I mean so much of of the negative emotions I have are due to you know in part having signed up  to do more than I may be physically physically capable of but also you know knowing that those  things are there and not doing it because and it's it's it's the not doing it that makes me uncomfortable  and unhappy it's it's not the actual process of doing it like like not doing it is holding 
95,0:34:25,0:36:24,SPEAKER 1, me back and from doing it in a weird way that makes sense right yeah no I mean a lot of it yeah  absolutely it's the the like dread of not doing something becomes overwhelming it becomes the  primary experience that you're having it becomes like it becomes the work you know like yeah  I've found that ever since I was a kid like I remember being a kid and my parents saying to me  if you just started this project when you started worrying about it it would be over you know like  and that's still true for me like I still it's still something I struggle with but that that's  what works for me is just like saying this starts now and we're gonna break it up into tiny little  parts and I'm not gonna judge myself for it being hard because it may not be hard for everyone but  it's super hard for me and that's the way it is uh-huh before we move on to the news from  Mars and AFC Wimbledon I want to um share an important piece of news okay thank you may remember  that a few weeks ago Sarah wrote in to ask about her husband shaving his head because he wanted to  shave his head to know what his head looks like um and we answered and we told him that he should  shave his head so there was a head shaving party good news Sarah reports that her husband's head  does not look weird shaved um and there is an amazing video of it of the highlights of the head  shaving party because they went all out it was a full on uh head shaving bash and we are putting that  on the patreon because it is just absolutely magnificent and this bash is uh it just appears to be  two people in a room with a with an election I mean you get first off you know that there is  a third person because somebody is holding the care okay three people three people is a party  Sarah is wearing what appears to be a formal gown so it is obviously a party 
96,0:36:24,0:36:30,SPEAKER 2, print john what oh that's an apron my mistake you are confused but there is another man another man 
97,0:36:30,0:37:10,SPEAKER 1, has shown up there is okay there's at least four people one of whom came pre pre-head shaved or at  least pre-balled oh yeah he was yeah he's he's not haved he's not in advance he's not shaved he  that just happened to him over over years is he drinking la croix very possibly hold on I got a  zoom in I got to go to 720p and that is a la croix in fact I can tell you right now I that's a  pink la croix what is that pink flavor is it crayon raspberry I've I've never had a pink la croix I  don't think I'm a real popular so yeah I can confirm that's a crayon raspberry la croix and I can  confirm that this is a party because if there's la croix and four people that is a bash 
98,0:37:13,0:37:19,SPEAKER 2, and I'm looking at his head his head is now shaved even more than his his face is and it looks great 
99,0:37:20,0:37:25,SPEAKER 1, good in terms of shape I'm gonna say it's just it's an a plus I think good head shape 
100,0:37:26,0:38:43,SPEAKER 2, John is the news from Mars well it looks like Elon Musk being you know our only chance  to beat our deadline of 2028 is has scheduled the launch the first test launch of the Falcon Heavy  rocket which is the the rocket that Iran hopes will will take people to Mars and has enough  oomph to to have people on top of it and get them all the way there and I will have its first  test launch not in 2013 John when it was first scheduled not in 2014 when it was second scheduled  but indeed this year in November John he's he has looking for 2027 it's not good not not good at  all indeed this this will test launch might not even reach space it probably will just be a super  test their their Mars mission dates have been pushed pushed back to 2018 and 2020 and it seems  unlikely that they'll hit that you know Elon Musk is good at getting stuff done but he's not and I'm  not saying that it's like I'm not saying this is a bad thing I'm pretty impressed honestly not  hitting deadlines but but also making things happen with it seems to be a lot of what's 
101,0:38:43,0:40:32,SPEAKER 1, happening with my my man Musk these days yeah he seems to be one of those people who realizes that  if he just slightly over promises then he can get people including himself to work harder yeah  like he was like we're gonna be done with the Tesla Model 3 in July and he was like look we finished  one word I didn't say I said ah not the ah you missed right that's right it's a huge difference  between and the Hank the news from AFC Wimbledon is that a contractor has been announced  well do you know how when you build a building  necessary to have a contractor like a contractor like a building okay yeah a contractor has  been announced for the new stadium at Plow Lane Andrew Scott limited which built Stoke City's  stadium they're in the Premier League now so I don't know if there's necessarily a one-to-one  correlation but let's we can keep our fingers crossed they are gonna be they are the preferred  contractor for the new stadium at Plow Lane really really exciting news because as each of  these little steps forward it becomes more and more likely that indeed there will be a new stadium  in Wimbledon's historic home maybe even for the 2019 2020 season meaning that AFC Wimbledon  are gonna be back home at least eight years before humans will be on Mars and probably 10  years or maybe even 14 16 40 oh god yeah I mean at this point you live to see a person on Mars 
102,0:40:32,0:40:54,SPEAKER 2, hey at this point I just I hope that I live to see human humanity discontinued to get better and  lots of different ways and whether that's our understanding and exploration of our solar system  and universe that's great but also just take care of each other and be a nice and not not not  driving not driving humans apart and make them angry at each other all the time Hank real 
103,0:40:54,0:41:38,SPEAKER 1, quickly I just have to break a little bit of political news to you people listening to this will be  listening to it of course in the future when all of this will be known but I'm about to tell you  something that you don't know which is that Donald Trump has just fired Anthony Scaremucci after eight  days as White House communications director and deeply shocking news oh my god that is amazing eight  days Hank well you know John I'm not I'm not sad about it no I don't think I don't I will not  miss him although I would like some continuity in American you know John you know what I want I want  to have never known that that guy exists yeah that would have been great but that's not how it went 
104,0:41:38,0:41:55,SPEAKER 2, down Hank what did we learn today that you can't keep track of this and like you just can't the  other day my mom said something about Cory Lewandowski and I was like who because it's just there's 
105,0:41:55,0:42:59,SPEAKER 1, too many of them and this is actually it's it's it's it's it's something of a strategy to have like  to have these news cycles be constant I think it must be a strategy because it's really effective  in a way like I have a lot of friends who've published books in the last six months and there's  a rule that you never publish a book in the like six months before an American presidential election  because you can't get any media to cover it because the only thing that the media is talking about  is politics and the genius of what's happened in the Trump administration I mean you can  say a lot of bad things about it and and we have but the genius of it is that it has taken  that six months before presidential election and extended it infinitely so now you also can't  get any media attention for your new book because people are too busy talking about the events of  the day well because the events of the day are always perpetually dramatic and astonishing yeah 
106,0:43:00,0:43:27,SPEAKER 2, and dramatic in it is the is the word because it's not it doesn't necessarily have a significant  effect on things but it is dramatic and it is it is sort of amazing and it's not just it's everything  like there in previous years we've had the ability to like win a famine on the level of the one  that is happening right now in Sudan could get some traction and there's just no space for it 
107,0:43:28,0:43:51,SPEAKER 1, nobody is right there's no space to talk about cholera and Yemen there's no space yeah no that's  very true and it's true for every news story that doesn't start Donald Trump today comma yeah  you know it's it's a weird time but we also learn that Oscars Oasis is a children's television  program with no words I learned that I have a feeling that you you knew that quite well we learned 
108,0:43:51,0:43:55,SPEAKER 2, that you got a friend book at John and you don't want to slash it too much but you don't want to 
109,0:43:55,0:44:01,SPEAKER 1, not slash it at all we learned that it is not okay to put your shows in someone else's netflix 
110,0:44:01,0:44:21,SPEAKER 2, queue no no and we learned that catheter and I should probably have separate Netflix account or  thingies so that it knows when to show up that good ol vicar from dibbly and when it knows to  show me what I would watch which is mostly just nature documentaries tank this is gonna stun you 
111,0:44:21,0:45:22,SPEAKER 1, because it stunned me mm-hmm are you ready is it more about the mooch oh no no it's that there is  actually no English place name dibbly it is a made up place name which seems so unlikely because  all English place names sound made up but the village of dibbly actually is made up  why didn't they just pick one of the amazing actual names no joke why didn't they just pick like  hurt for sure land bottoms or whatever  oh god what do you want to see what yeah oh wet wet oh god nothing matters thanks for listening  to uh your Hank and John if you have questions you can email us at Hank and John at gmail.com  we apologize for making the Trump media inundation worse by mentioning him here at the end of the  pod that's that's our bad uh but you can email us at Hank and John at gmail.com your emails are always 
112,0:45:22,0:45:27,SPEAKER 2, welcome and appreciated I also have to apologize because of course by next Monday when this comes out

114,0:45:33,0:45:38,SPEAKER 2, been fired in the interim Anthony Scaremucci will have been fired for longer than he was hired by that 
115,0:45:38,0:45:54,SPEAKER 1, point Hank before I got you read the credits I just want to uh Rosiana just sent me a tweet from  at sarcastic rover the uh Mars rover who is professionally sarcastic uh huh who tweeted  Mars is so far away from earth that we only just heard about Scaremucci getting hired as communications 
116,0:45:54,0:46:28,SPEAKER 2, director congratulations I'm sure things going great uh this podcast is produced by Rosiana  Halsey Rojas and Sheridan Gibson it's edited by Nicholas Jenkins Victoria Bon Giorno is our head of  community and communications and it handles all of our patreon stuff you can go over and check our  great patreon where you can see that that you're deeply tattooed and also dude getting a said  shape uh if you want to email us that's at Hank and John at gmail.com we are on Twitter John's John  Green I'm Hank Green this music that you're hearing is by the great gutter rola and as they say in
