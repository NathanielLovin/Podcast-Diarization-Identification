0,0:00:00,0:00:18,SPEAKER 1," Did you just pee on the graph?  You peed in front of the cat!  You fell on the graph!  Hey, violent. "
1,0:00:18,0:00:19,SPEAKER 3, Are we rolling? 
2,0:00:19,0:00:20,SPEAKER 4, You're breathing. 
3,0:00:20,0:00:22,SPEAKER 1, You're breathing so heavy. 
4,0:00:22,0:00:27,SPEAKER 3, Let me get a...  Dorito's instant replay on that burrito. 
5,0:00:27,0:00:31,SPEAKER 4, You're just wheezing.  You're wheezing through it.  You spilled it all over your pants. 
6,0:00:31,0:00:32,SPEAKER 3," You're on some coral right now, bro. "
7,0:00:32,0:00:34,SPEAKER 1, You used to be able to bench 225. 
8,0:00:34,0:00:35,SPEAKER 4, God. 
9,0:00:35,0:00:36,SPEAKER 3, I think you're still good. 
10,0:00:36,0:00:38,SPEAKER 1, You are over your pants. 
11,0:00:38,0:00:40,SPEAKER 4, You are struggling to breathe. 
12,0:00:40,0:00:45,SPEAKER 3," All over your pants now.  Those look nice.  That's disgusting.  No, you don't rub it in with the napkin. "
13,0:00:45,0:00:47,SPEAKER 4, Now it's the same.  Are you gonna finish it all like a good little boy? 
14,0:00:47,0:00:48,SPEAKER 1, You're close. 
15,0:00:48,0:00:49,SPEAKER 4, Are you gonna finish it all? 
16,0:00:49,0:00:50,SPEAKER 3, I have a tide pen. 
17,0:00:50,0:00:52,SPEAKER 4, You can be a good little boy about it. 
18,0:00:52,0:00:54,SPEAKER 3," Oh, we don't even have our fire plays.  Are you gonna take it all? "
19,0:00:54,0:00:57,SPEAKER 4, I'm gonna take it all.  That's yummy. 
20,0:00:57,0:00:58,SPEAKER 1, We can... 
21,0:00:58,0:00:59,SPEAKER 4, Is it chicken? 
22,0:00:59,0:01:04,SPEAKER 2," Welcome back to yard, everybody. "
23,0:01:04,0:01:05,SPEAKER 1, This is actually... 
24,0:01:05,0:01:16,SPEAKER 3," I mean this.  I'm not kidding.  This is your best fit.  Well, island hat with the fish feet.  But then a relatively normal guy in between.  You're like a weird sandwich. "
25,0:01:16,0:01:19,SPEAKER 1," Hey, can I hit that?  No. "
26,0:01:19,0:01:20,SPEAKER 2, Why? 
27,0:01:20,0:01:21,SPEAKER 1, I've eaten today. 
28,0:01:21,0:01:22,SPEAKER 4, I didn't eat. 
29,0:01:22,0:01:23,SPEAKER 2, I barely ate. 
30,0:01:23,0:01:25,SPEAKER 4, You'd take Adderall.  I didn't take Adderall today. 
31,0:01:25,0:01:29,SPEAKER 3," Well, I came home and opened up a pizza box that had a napkin in it and said... "
32,0:01:29,0:01:30,SPEAKER 1, Boo! 
33,0:01:30,0:01:34,SPEAKER 3, He said pizza!  And then he just started eating it.  And he was a live here anymore. 
34,0:01:34,0:01:35,SPEAKER 2, In a Disney movie? 
35,0:01:35,0:01:36,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
36,0:01:36,0:01:38,SPEAKER 3, And he didn't live here anymore.  So he was just like... 
37,0:01:38,0:01:46,SPEAKER 4, I did check the receipt.  That was my detective work.  It was ordered last night.  And it was Nick because it said his name on it. 
38,0:01:46,0:01:47,SPEAKER 3, And it was delicious. 
39,0:01:47,0:01:49,SPEAKER 4, Like he's not gonna eat the rest of this. 
40,0:01:49,0:02:04,SPEAKER 3," We were in hell last night because we put off the postcards.  Who far this time?  Because usually when we put them off, we still can split it across two days.  Also, for those who don't know what we're talking about in our Patreon, tier three is an up-get-sent postcards that we sign.  And... "
41,0:02:04,0:02:06,SPEAKER 4," Well, we don't just sign them.  We put little cute messages. "
42,0:02:06,0:02:11,SPEAKER 3," Well, messages might write your name and I say, hey...  I'm feeding your parasocial brain.  Do you like that? "
43,0:02:11,0:02:14,SPEAKER 2, I was first to do it.  Because I love my fans.  I love you. 
44,0:02:14,0:02:16,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, I love you was the first to finish. "
45,0:02:16,0:02:20,SPEAKER 4," I did...  You know, I cheated.  I did Ludwig.  I did Ludwig. "
46,0:02:20,0:02:21,SPEAKER 1, He Ludwig did. 
47,0:02:21,0:02:24,SPEAKER 4," I just signed them.  Really?  Yeah, I didn't have time last night. "
48,0:02:24,0:02:26,SPEAKER 1," Well...  Meanwhile, I'm me and Nick. "
49,0:02:26,0:02:27,SPEAKER 3, We're in the trenches. 
50,0:02:27,0:02:31,SPEAKER 1, We're in the trenches.  We're sitting at the table talking about telling these kids about top one for it. 
51,0:02:31,0:02:42,SPEAKER 3," It's like, Aiden can't think of any ideas.  He's looking over at my cards.  And I'm writing fucking...  I'm writing smoke, dude.  I'm just like fucking...  Yeah, you're on a roll.  I'm writing, like, I'm not Adam, but Shorty turned me to a savage.  Hundred emoji. "
52,0:02:42,0:02:43,SPEAKER 1," Right, yeah, yeah. "
53,0:02:43,0:02:49,SPEAKER 3," And then he would lean over and goes, Nick's name is not Adam, but Shorty turned him to a hundred emoji.  And I was looking up... "
54,0:02:50,0:03:03,SPEAKER 4," I was writing.  It's so bad.  I remember earlier on in the Patreon, I would get kind of nervous and mad at his postcards,  because I'm like, these are fucking terrible.  This is, like, you're giving this person a piece of shit product. "
55,0:03:03,0:03:09,SPEAKER 3," So Aiden's cards like this.  John from Colorado writes in, and he writes, hey, John, how's Colorado? "
56,0:03:13,0:03:15,SPEAKER 2, But it's better than what you did this month. 
57,0:03:15,0:03:17,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, I just did the Ludwig.  So I have no... "
58,0:03:17,0:03:24,SPEAKER 3," The layup is that if John from Colorado would reply to him and go, Colorado is really good.  I'm like going to college.  He would be like, oh, dude, that's fucking sweet. "
59,0:03:24,0:03:25,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, it's actually a talk to him. "
60,0:03:25,0:03:26,SPEAKER 3, Yeah. 
61,0:03:26,0:03:27,SPEAKER 1, Is that crazy? 
62,0:03:27,0:03:30,SPEAKER 2, He just does the first line of an Uber conversation that will never finish. 
63,0:03:30,0:03:35,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, and then some people reply to you and then you learn something interesting.  You've penned this? "
64,0:03:35,0:03:39,SPEAKER 4," Well, no, at the same time, you have 20 unread DMs.  You piece a shit. "
65,0:03:39,0:03:40,SPEAKER 1, It's the same thing. 
66,0:03:40,0:03:41,SPEAKER 4, So many right now. 
67,0:03:41,0:03:46,SPEAKER 1," They see?  So there's, like, you really just...  You cannot have it all. "
68,0:03:46,0:03:51,SPEAKER 3," If I can put a pin on the talk shit on Aiden part of the episode, because we're going to move to Ludwig real soon.  Wait, what? "
69,0:03:51,0:03:52,SPEAKER 1," Oh, yeah. "
70,0:03:52,0:03:55,SPEAKER 4, Because you didn't do anything wrong today. 
71,0:03:55,0:03:56,SPEAKER 1, Right now. 
72,0:03:56,0:03:57,SPEAKER 4, Right now. 
73,0:03:57,0:04:16,SPEAKER 3," Aiden messages me.  So we were a week late on the advice show.  Because I'm okay with my life.  And I messaged Aiden, I'm like, yeah, we gotta do advice.  And we're supposed to do it at night.  And I'm on my way home and I messaged Aiden, like, hey, I'm on my way home.  He goes, hey, I'm just too tired to do it tonight.  Can we push tomorrow?  And I'm like, yeah, that's fine.  Hold on. "
74,0:04:16,0:04:22,SPEAKER 1," Hold on.  Only because he was late, because we said we would do it at seven.  So it is now 10.30.  Make us arrive to the home late. "
75,0:04:22,0:04:38,SPEAKER 3," That's fine.  I don't actually think I changed anything.  I did push two hours that day.  But I was still like, let's do it tonight.  It was only 9 p.m.  So I'm like, on my way home, like, let's do it.  He's like, honestly, I'm just too tired on the end of it anymore.  I get home.  And then he types in the fucking matchmaking chat.  Does anyone want to play agency?  That's crazy. "
76,0:04:38,0:04:38,SPEAKER 1," And then he comes downstairs and he's like, "
77,0:04:38,0:04:40,SPEAKER 3, Anyone want to play Counter-Strike?  That is. 
78,0:04:40,0:04:54,SPEAKER 1, What the fuck is that?  It can be an agency.  Agencies comes out of me with raw Instagram.  I don't have to think.  I just feel agency.  It's a part of you.  The advice show is a lot of thought and articulation.  But agency.  You can't. 
79,0:04:54,0:04:56,SPEAKER 4, You can't. 
80,0:04:56,0:04:56,SPEAKER 1, It just has to come out at some time. 
81,0:04:56,0:04:58,SPEAKER 2, I don't think he plays good enough for you to be mad at him. 
82,0:04:58,0:05:00,SPEAKER 4, You can't have help.  But you can't have the night off. 
83,0:05:00,0:05:04,SPEAKER 3, He doesn't have to touch your two times alive on agency. 
84,0:05:04,0:05:08,SPEAKER 4, That is insane.  At least pretend that you're doing something like we were shooting. 
85,0:05:08,0:05:16,SPEAKER 3," When we finally did record the advice show,  I was wearing a Batman mask the whole time.  I had like this shitty Batman mask on. "
86,0:05:16,0:05:18,SPEAKER 4," By the way, it's an audio only experience. "
87,0:05:18,0:05:30,SPEAKER 3," If you go to the advice show, the thumbnail was me in the bathroom.  I think Zepert pulled it up.  I put it on Twitter on, I think it was my Twitter.  And I'm wearing it.  And Aiden picks the most fucking dark topic we've ever had. "
88,0:05:30,0:05:30,SPEAKER 1, Oh no. 
89,0:05:30,0:05:32,SPEAKER 3, On the episode. 
90,0:05:32,0:05:34,SPEAKER 1, I'm just very serious.  I'm wearing the Batman mask. 
91,0:05:34,0:05:42,SPEAKER 3," And at some point halfway through reading about someone's trauma,  he looks over at me.  And I can only imagine he's seeing me in the photo. "
92,0:05:42,0:05:54,SPEAKER 1," And he just starts laughing.  I've been reading.  I've been reading the question, right?  I'm lost in the question.  Because this is going.  I'm reading it.  I'm like, fuck man.  I'm not qualified to answer this. "
93,0:05:54,0:05:56,SPEAKER 4, I wish you were playing agency again. 
94,0:05:56,0:06:12,SPEAKER 1, We're half an agency would have made me feel great at the time.  And I finally look up.  Because I even made eye contact with Nick  and maybe like two straight minutes.  I look up and I see him leaned over in his seat like this.  And he's still Batman mask on.  And he's just shaking his head. 
95,0:06:12,0:06:16,SPEAKER 4, Oh my god. 
96,0:06:16,0:06:20,SPEAKER 2," Dude, okay.  Advice show.  But you do the Batman voice the whole time. "
97,0:06:20,0:06:20,SPEAKER 3," Oh, I did that. "
98,0:06:20,0:06:22,SPEAKER 2, It's only really dark topics. 
99,0:06:24,0:06:30,SPEAKER 1," Dude, we're doing the show.  The latest we've ever done it.  It's almost 1am.  We never record this. "
100,0:06:30,0:06:32,SPEAKER 3, I get how the identity works. 
101,0:06:32,0:06:40,SPEAKER 1," He's wrapped.  He's wrapped in a blanket.  He's wrapped in a blanket at his Batman mask.  Jacob.  Jacob, you need to communicate with her.  But yeah, I get what you mean. "
102,0:06:40,0:06:44,SPEAKER 2," Jacob, that sexual assault was not Jacob.  We's not that you need to communicate with your girlfriend. "
103,0:06:44,0:06:46,SPEAKER 4, You look like you're like a 45 year old. 
104,0:06:46,0:06:50,SPEAKER 3," I'm being only side lit by a monitor,  which is not quite how moved by it. "
105,0:06:50,0:06:54,SPEAKER 2, I also get why Bruce Wayne gets away with it.  Yeah. 
106,0:06:54,0:06:56,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.  You're looking at that.  Who could that be? 
107,0:06:56,0:06:58,SPEAKER 4, Yeah. 
108,0:06:58,0:07:00,SPEAKER 2, I've never seen that billionaire in my life. 
109,0:07:00,0:07:00,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
110,0:07:00,0:07:04,SPEAKER 3, And then also how about that?  We watched BrainCon the D-Com episode.  Just a fire week. 
111,0:07:04,0:07:06,SPEAKER 2, It's a hot one. 
112,0:07:06,0:07:06,SPEAKER 3, Fire week in the Patreon. 
113,0:07:06,0:07:08,SPEAKER 2, How about it? 
114,0:07:08,0:07:10,SPEAKER 1, Pretty good.  It definitely was.  Oh my god. 
115,0:07:10,0:07:20,SPEAKER 3," Well, for what?  The movie starts really high.  Like, it was like a 90s D-Coms  when there's still like really high production value  and a lot of heart and effort put in.  But then towards the end,  it just kind of like gets more boring. "
116,0:07:20,0:07:32,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, and I argued it doesn't get boring.  It just is the template for what we already...  What we now consider like how movies are supposed to go.  Now we have to subredate. "
117,0:07:32,0:07:32,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
118,0:07:32,0:07:36,SPEAKER 4," But if you're the first to do it,  you know, you got there first.  And I think it's like the quintessential. "
119,0:07:36,0:07:44,SPEAKER 3," It's not quite a timeless banger.  But there were movies.  Visually, it was very striking.  And what's going on over here?  He just stole a tomato from my... "
120,0:07:44,0:07:46,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, I wish I was sitting over there "
121,0:07:46,0:07:50,SPEAKER 4," because I could do that.  You're like coot.  But it's fucking gatekeeper, master,  fucking milk island.  Don't touch my shit over here, bro. "
122,0:07:50,0:07:52,SPEAKER 2, What if I didn't handle my meat? 
123,0:07:52,0:07:56,SPEAKER 4," What if I...  What if I...  Oh, I'm correct, bro.  I came over there and I licked it.  Like it was. "
124,0:07:56,0:07:58,SPEAKER 2, Who knows what I do to her? 
125,0:07:58,0:07:58,SPEAKER 3, What do you do? 
126,0:07:58,0:08:00,SPEAKER 2," I'm putting her in her place, bro. "
127,0:08:00,0:08:00,SPEAKER 1, You throw her against her wall. 
128,0:08:00,0:08:02,SPEAKER 4," Like a fucking prank fruit.  Wait, I don't know. "
129,0:08:02,0:08:06,SPEAKER 3, Buse my bed.  Let's try and get a bite if he crawls over like a kitten. 
130,0:08:06,0:08:06,SPEAKER 2," Uh, if... "
131,0:08:06,0:08:08,SPEAKER 4, Let me be me. 
132,0:08:08,0:08:08,SPEAKER 2, No. 
133,0:08:08,0:08:10,SPEAKER 4, No? Why? 
134,0:08:10,0:08:14,SPEAKER 2, Because I don't want him to crawl like a kitten.  He won't be cute.  It'll be like one of those old cats that's like... 
135,0:08:14,0:08:16,SPEAKER 4," Oh, like Ders? "
136,0:08:16,0:08:18,SPEAKER 2, Just clinging on to the last bit.  Ders is five. 
137,0:08:18,0:08:24,SPEAKER 4, Ders is five?  Ders looks like...  Ders is going through a fucking manic episode.  Ders looks like five cats. 
138,0:08:24,0:08:24,SPEAKER 3, It's mush together. 
139,0:08:24,0:08:30,SPEAKER 1, It's really fucked up.  Ders looks five!  Because it's just tortures Ders by the way. 
140,0:08:30,0:08:42,SPEAKER 4, And you guys don't know.  Ders was so grumpy getting shaved that the groomer couldn't finish the job.  So it looks like he gave himself like a fucking haircut in the mirror  while crying and listening to fucking... 
141,0:08:42,0:08:44,SPEAKER 2, Better than being bald. 
142,0:08:44,0:08:44,SPEAKER 4," Is it, though? "
143,0:08:44,0:08:46,SPEAKER 1, Ders looks like the guy.  It is. 
144,0:08:46,0:08:52,SPEAKER 4," I don't know.  If it's like a patch of hair that's like right here  and the rest is fucking falling out, I think... "
145,0:08:52,0:08:54,SPEAKER 2, The stylistic choice. 
146,0:08:54,0:08:54,SPEAKER 1, It's not. 
147,0:08:54,0:08:56,SPEAKER 4," Dude, if he had... "
148,0:08:56,0:09:00,SPEAKER 3," If he had the horseshoe bald, what's that called?  The horseshoe bald. "
149,0:09:00,0:09:00,SPEAKER 4, The Norwood. 
150,0:09:00,0:09:02,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, when you had...  Dude, that'd be so awesome. "
151,0:09:02,0:09:04,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, babies come out like that sometimes. "
152,0:09:04,0:09:06,SPEAKER 2, The phase bangs talking about? 
153,0:09:06,0:09:10,SPEAKER 3, No.  What's that?  What's going on under that hat? 
154,0:09:10,0:09:16,SPEAKER 1, Do you know all the banks?  Do you think...  Do you think there's like an American rat under that hat  who's been leading phase clay at this whole time? 
155,0:09:16,0:09:20,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, he's got little levers. "
156,0:09:20,0:09:22,SPEAKER 4, He's got hand tattoos. 
157,0:09:22,0:09:26,SPEAKER 3, He's looking over if the F-slur button constantly like...  It's been 20-30. 
158,0:09:26,0:09:28,SPEAKER 2, It's been 20-30. 
159,0:09:28,0:09:30,SPEAKER 1, I wish he was 10 years ago. 
160,0:09:30,0:09:30,SPEAKER 2, I wish I could go back. 
161,0:09:30,0:09:34,SPEAKER 1, He's smoking a darn new U. 
162,0:09:34,0:09:36,SPEAKER 2, We were so much better back then. 
163,0:09:36,0:10:04,SPEAKER 3," It's me, it's making of traumatizing arcats.  Aiden comes in the fucking room last night  while we're doing postcards.  He's got a bunch of like outlet converters  because we're going to Australia at his hands.  And he turns around.  I think he's just still holding on like doing something  but he's just turning around kind of fiddling with nothing.  And me and Yingling are like, what is he doing?  And then you hear human piss start to hit the ground  in our house.  And he just starts peeing on the floor like he's sleepwalking. "
164,0:10:04,0:10:04,SPEAKER 2, You fuck his wrong with you. 
165,0:10:04,0:10:12,SPEAKER 3," And me and Nick, for like five full seconds,  it's like when you think you're been a drink of milk  but it's spright. "
166,0:10:12,0:10:14,SPEAKER 1, And there's nothing wrong with spry. 
167,0:10:14,0:10:20,SPEAKER 3, But you're trying to figure out what your brain is trying to figure out  what's going on in the world.  And I realized he's peeing on the floor. 
168,0:10:20,0:10:24,SPEAKER 1," And then I'm like, I literally, I don't even ask him. "
169,0:10:24,0:10:26,SPEAKER 3," I just lean to Yingling.  I go, he's peeing. "
170,0:10:26,0:10:26,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
171,0:10:26,0:10:28,SPEAKER 3, And he just keeps peeing. 
172,0:10:28,0:10:32,SPEAKER 1," And then he's wrong with you.  And then he puts up, he pulls his pants up. "
173,0:10:32,0:10:38,SPEAKER 3," And he turns around and he's just got a little bit of dribble.  And yeah, a little bit of dribble and his belt undone. "
174,0:10:38,0:10:38,SPEAKER 1, And then he starts laughing. 
175,0:10:38,0:10:42,SPEAKER 3," And he goes, yeah.  I thought that would be funny. "
176,0:10:42,0:10:44,SPEAKER 1, Walk me through. 
177,0:10:44,0:10:48,SPEAKER 3, And then he starts cleaning it with Fubri's. 
178,0:10:48,0:10:52,SPEAKER 1, Really?  Really?  Why did you choose a good cleaner? 
179,0:10:52,0:10:54,SPEAKER 2," Because it's chemicals, doesn't mean it cleans. "
180,0:10:54,0:10:56,SPEAKER 1, He starts spraying.  That's a deodorizer. 
181,0:10:56,0:11:00,SPEAKER 3, Fabric deodorizer on it and wiping it around. 
182,0:11:00,0:11:00,SPEAKER 1, Why did you do that? 
183,0:11:00,0:11:02,SPEAKER 4, Why did you select that one? 
184,0:11:02,0:11:04,SPEAKER 2," Also, not much room to talk. "
185,0:11:04,0:11:12,SPEAKER 1," No, no, I'm just curious.  That's the hallway closet where we put all the cleaning supplies  and there was only one bottle. "
186,0:11:12,0:11:14,SPEAKER 4, Did you look under the sink of the kitchen where that shit used to be? 
187,0:11:14,0:11:16,SPEAKER 1, You didn't go there. 
188,0:11:16,0:11:16,SPEAKER 4, So I grabbed it. 
189,0:11:16,0:11:38,SPEAKER 1," I grabbed it without thinking.  It started cleaning with it.  And then somebody added in the Twitter post,  they were like, it's another layer of insanity  that he's cleaning this with Fubri's.  And then I looked at the bottle.  And it was like, oh, that's not disinfectant.  Wow.  So I went up to the kitchen.  I cleaned everything again. "
190,0:11:38,0:11:42,SPEAKER 3, Coots was curious all night about what's going on right here. 
191,0:11:42,0:11:48,SPEAKER 4, Did you drink any of your piss?  No.  Did you drink some of your piss?  No.  Like a milk from a saucer? 
192,0:11:48,0:11:50,SPEAKER 2, Did you give a small child cat your piss to drink? 
193,0:11:50,0:11:54,SPEAKER 3, No.  It's like curvy.  Coots with a little pink fat on the top. 
194,0:11:54,0:12:00,SPEAKER 1," I was responsible.  I was responsible.  As soon as I did it, I picked Coots up.  Put him in there. "
195,0:12:00,0:12:02,SPEAKER 2," Sorry, sorry.  Fuck you mean responsible. "
196,0:12:02,0:12:04,SPEAKER 3," No, no, no, no. "
197,0:12:04,0:12:06,SPEAKER 2, You're dick out in a living room in front of people  and peed on the ground. 
198,0:12:06,0:12:08,SPEAKER 4, Not people. 
199,0:12:08,0:12:12,SPEAKER 2," No, you shut the fuck up.  You smash the hammer against the wall.  You didn't even put any for breeze in it. "
200,0:12:12,0:12:14,SPEAKER 1, He didn't clean it up. 
201,0:12:14,0:12:14,SPEAKER 3, We're the last of the Mohican. 
202,0:12:14,0:12:18,SPEAKER 1, That corner of the room is arguably cleaner  than it was before I peed there.  That's true. 
203,0:12:18,0:12:26,SPEAKER 3," That is what he said right after.  And I said, that sounds like something  we would make up that you would say  if you did this in a hypothetical world. "
204,0:12:26,0:12:28,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
205,0:12:28,0:12:32,SPEAKER 3," Like we'd be like, I'm out of an aid in pissing in the living room.  He's like, it's cleaner now.  It was literally cleaner than it was before.  And he said it unironically after. "
206,0:12:32,0:12:34,SPEAKER 4, I feel like true. 
207,0:12:34,0:12:34,SPEAKER 1, What is it? 
208,0:12:34,0:12:36,SPEAKER 2, It's not true. 
209,0:12:36,0:12:38,SPEAKER 1, It's not true.  It's not true. 
210,0:12:38,0:12:38,SPEAKER 2, It's not true. 
211,0:12:38,0:12:42,SPEAKER 3, It's not true.  It's not true.  You're in a sanitary.  That's what he says to me. 
212,0:12:42,0:12:46,SPEAKER 1, That's all true.  It's like that's why you can drink in a bare grow roll. 
213,0:12:46,0:12:50,SPEAKER 3," I was like, don't be a fucking fun fat guy right now.  You just pissed on the whole. "
214,0:12:50,0:12:52,SPEAKER 4," I think when you're in that spot, you need to pull all the stuff. "
215,0:12:52,0:12:56,SPEAKER 2, It's a big difference between sterile and sanitary.  Big difference. 
216,0:12:56,0:12:56,SPEAKER 4, I mean it's sterile. 
217,0:12:56,0:12:58,SPEAKER 1, It's sterile and it can't pee on a pyreol. 
218,0:12:58,0:13:02,SPEAKER 4, Because you could have Hepatitis.  Like H-Box has. 
219,0:13:02,0:13:04,SPEAKER 1, I do. 
220,0:13:04,0:13:22,SPEAKER 4," Anyway, but I think that was really...  I saw all this happen on Twitter  because I wasn't there that night  and I'm like, a couple of things ran through my head.  ran through my head. One is me not being around sort of some sort of evil force that needs  to infect someone's ghoulish prime is just whoever the ghost in habit. I've been building "
221,0:13:22,0:14:25,SPEAKER 1," up to this. I've been building up to this because two weeks ago, two weeks ago, it would  Josh was still here. Me, Josh, and you know, we're going out walks and we're going outside.  We walk around the neighborhood like a bunch of hooligans. We're just fucking in jeans but  shirtless and it's the three of us like roaming our neighborhood. We were leaving and I really  needed to pee and I was like, you know what would be funny? It's because they're stating  across the street. If I peed in front of them in the yard but like so that I lined it up  so that the mailbox is blocking my dick. Okay. And I did this. Yeah, I remember this.  I remember them talking about this and it was funny and I'm like, and then yesterday  I brought in the chargers and I'm like, I do not want to continue to sign these postcards  right now. I really need to pee. It'd probably be funny if I did it right in front of  them. This is your internal monologue. Yes. What I think happened is slime when he goes "
222,0:14:25,0:14:31,SPEAKER 2," into his chambers, draws an arrow in his forehead, enters the avatar stage and goes into "
223,0:14:31,0:14:35,SPEAKER 4," one of our bodies. Oh, like, man, I have it. Those guys haven't fucking dealt with anything "
224,0:14:35,0:14:41,SPEAKER 3, in a while. Let me astral project real quick. Put on the VR goggles and start walking around 
225,0:14:41,0:14:45,SPEAKER 4, with Aiden. Yeah. But Aiden's so nice. He doesn't understand that his body's being 
226,0:14:45,0:15:10,SPEAKER 1," inhabited. And you have to do an act that he would do. And if it's too far out, then  you break out of the action. Yeah. Yeah. Me, me and Coots, me and Coots are the same because  that guy's been pissing and shitting everywhere. Yeah. And Coots doesn't wipe his up with  claw rocks afterwards. Wow. Is that true? Well, so the problem is he just stopped. It's  so funny because he was using his letterbox and then he just stopped. There's two letterboxes. "
227,0:15:10,0:15:14,SPEAKER 3," There's like, there's any letterboxes dead. That item, bros, is my house and then adult "
228,0:15:14,0:15:18,SPEAKER 2," cat letterboxes. And we tried to pivot to the adult cat, but she just doesn't like the "
229,0:15:18,0:15:31,SPEAKER 3," way it smells. It's like diapers for cats. I think cats just inherently know where you  want them to go. And then they go other places, not go like piss, like B physically, like  cats are like on top of your laptop when you're working. What if instead of diapers, "
230,0:15:31,0:15:42,SPEAKER 4, we had an area that we should shit. That's the toilet. Yeah. No. No. No. I can't make 
231,0:15:42,0:15:54,SPEAKER 1," it through this one. You're awesome. What if we had a rocket? And then the spot, the spot,  like, it was filled with water. It like self-cleaned for the next person every time you "
232,0:15:54,0:16:12,SPEAKER 4," used it. There's a, there's an old podcast. You said, doers, like they, they talked about  how we, we usually don't look at our shit. Oh, fuck. After the Carl Jacobs episode, I was  like, oh, man, we got it. We got to start being more appealing to women. And also don't  replace me. Please God don't replace me. Well, but that episode was one of 10. It was five. "
233,0:16:12,0:16:23,SPEAKER 3," It was two of 10. Two of 10. No way. You're still in. No. Well, it beat Mr. Beast. That's  crazy. But it lost to Connor, who is by far our most viewed. It is going to become an "
234,0:16:23,0:16:37,SPEAKER 4," a million view episode probably. I feel bad too, because I feel like I, I kind of shit  the bed with that one by doing too many accents. Yeah. You did. I was like, uh-oh. I'm fine  for my life in those comments too. Why? Because fuck those guys. Fuck those weeb nerd "
235,0:16:37,0:16:42,SPEAKER 2, pussies. They are right in that you did too many accents because you know you did too 
236,0:16:42,0:16:46,SPEAKER 4," many. No, they said my accents were bad. They are. They're, yeah, but that's from Connor's "
237,0:16:46,0:16:50,SPEAKER 3," own mouth. They were bad. So I was like, Oh, hi, have you episode, Pog? But wait, but "
238,0:16:50,0:17:03,SPEAKER 4," I don't want viewers to watch. No, you're telling me that I was just fighting for my life  at Thompson. And everyone who hates me and is mad at me, me and Connor are friends. So put "
239,0:17:03,0:17:08,SPEAKER 2, that in your pipe and smoke it. Are you hoping like Archie edits him in here? Yeah. Archie 
240,0:17:08,0:17:12,SPEAKER 3, right there. I want you to put Connor and I want him to look real like like a short leg 
241,0:17:12,0:17:17,SPEAKER 4, feet than me then hip. There's no shins like they got blown off and numb. Yeah. So his 
242,0:17:17,0:17:34,SPEAKER 3," episode went crazy. I think because we have so much overlap with trash taste in our audience,  speaking of we lost a bet to their podcast. Oh, right. Uh, yeah. Jerma really choked  that one, huh? Oh, uh, well, you were driving. Uh, what's the concept? Okay. At the Bury "
243,0:17:34,0:17:57,SPEAKER 2," O'Carte World Cup World Cup World Cup World Cup World Cup World Cup. I ran. It was 16  players. And it was we were playing double dash on land. Uh, it was like top four, cause  it finals, whatever. Mango and fucking Josh man crushed. What's the, what's the Kazooie  in the backpack? Yeah, Kazooie in the backpack. And he was chirping. And mangoes his banjo run "
244,0:17:57,0:18:01,SPEAKER 4, around. Yeah. Josh's Kazooie impression and his banjo compression and his grow until 
245,0:18:01,0:18:06,SPEAKER 1, the impression are all extremely good. He actually brought out the angry drunk in me. And 
246,0:18:06,0:18:34,SPEAKER 2," I understand that being angry drunk is not a meat thing. It's just if I'm hanging out with an  Australian and happy to be drinking. Yeah. Cause Miles was brought out last time. I don't  fuck with Australians when I'm drunk. Yeah. You are true. Yeah. They like, so he, we basically  had like four races and you could pass off the controller and have someone else drink for you.  So he passes it to mango. Mango does three races in a row first every time. He's just a fucking  god of the game. And Josh the whole time is like, well, not driving too good, are we? "
247,0:18:35,0:18:40,SPEAKER 3," And a lot of me is like, you are literally such a pussy and Josh is like, wait, wait, "
248,0:18:44,0:18:48,SPEAKER 2," while the race is happening, by the way, because he doesn't need to do anything. Cause he's "
249,0:18:48,0:18:57,SPEAKER 1," in the backpack. He's so cool. Do when Josh would race. Is there mashing the stick back and forth  for mango to get boosts on the turns? And that's all he has to do. Do when Josh is racing, "
250,0:18:57,0:19:04,SPEAKER 3," dude, he fell off rainbow road, maybe 50 times in one race. He is dog shit. It's actually insane "
251,0:19:04,0:19:10,SPEAKER 1," how bad he is at that game, considering how good he is at melee. True. Was it singly limb bracket? "
252,0:19:10,0:19:15,SPEAKER 2," No, it was like a, it was like a format where you get points based off play sings in a grand "
253,0:19:15,0:19:24,SPEAKER 4, pre. Okay. Did Amon design it? Yeah. Okay. Do you think he did a good job? I think the format  was actually really fun. Really interesting. Yeah. You lost it. And you play double dash more than 
254,0:19:24,0:19:32,SPEAKER 2," anyone. It was guaranteed that we were losing. No, I, mango plays more than me, but it was  guaranteed that mango was winning. And so we made a side bet. It was me and Jerm against Connor "
255,0:19:32,0:19:45,SPEAKER 1," in Joey. And in Joey don't trash taste Joey's on trash. Yeah. Does he look like Joey from friends?  No, not at all. Okay. Thank you. Go ahead. He's an Australian Japanese. So he kind of does, "
256,0:19:45,0:19:50,SPEAKER 2," which is what you said that was weird, but I almost said it like he was a mecca. I recognize "
257,0:19:50,0:19:54,SPEAKER 3," when I say if you give him a moonstone, he evolves immediately, which is cool. Yeah. "
258,0:19:55,0:20:01,SPEAKER 2," Well, so that, so it was like it came down to the last race and I took Jermis beer, "
259,0:20:01,0:20:09,SPEAKER 1, because Jermis was not a phenomenal racer. He has not played a game that was the phenomenal  drinker. He's a phenomenal drinker. That's good. We're probably on par. He drank just as much as 
260,0:20:09,0:20:26,SPEAKER 3," everyone else. And he was just talking to me like nothing happened. That's the model. And he's  just chilling. And I'm like, are you drunk? He's like, yeah, I'm drunk. And I'm like, you are so normal.  What a goat. And then he's just explaining. He's just explaining his next stream to me. And I'm  like, you're the goat. Mango also like that. Yeah. Yeah. I was like, I was a mego. And I said, "
261,0:20:26,0:21:05,SPEAKER 2," you are dead sober. He's like, absolutely. Can you pull the picture on my Twitter of me and mego?  Anyway, it's the final race. I'm in the lead the entire time. Mango, the fucking snake looks at my  screen. Literally screen peaks has a lightning times it. So when I'm off a jump, I fall and die. Yeah.  And then, and then we didn't explain the bet. And the bet was if we beat trash chase guys,  we get a one minute shout out in their pod in vice versa. Yeah. So now there's prone clone.  There's a one minute ad. We have to do one minute ad read for trash. They do it. And it goes.  Honestly, it would be way better if we did it in way funnier and it wouldn't be as good of a "
262,0:21:05,0:21:09,SPEAKER 4," shout. So are you saying we're funnier than them? No, I'm saying we would not do it funnier than us. "
263,0:21:09,0:21:19,SPEAKER 2," I'm saying we wouldn't do it honestly. Yeah, we definitely talked before the show about how we  could. I won't say what you're trying to scam them. Yeah, yeah, we can't do that. That's okay. "
264,0:21:19,0:21:22,SPEAKER 4, So we film it. Okay. But do you think they're funnier than us? 
265,0:21:24,0:21:29,SPEAKER 2, I think they're they're funnier than you. What did you expect? 
266,0:21:29,0:21:34,SPEAKER 4," By the way, I just know that's not true. Well, so I'm just gonna let that better at accents. "
267,0:21:34,0:21:38,SPEAKER 3," Look, I'll say about all say about Connor. It's not an accent if you're born with it. "
268,0:21:38,0:21:50,SPEAKER 1," No, that's good. Connor's Chinese is so good. He's Chinese American accent.  She's a problematic one. Yeah, he does it offline all the time. It's so funny. "
269,0:21:51,0:22:12,SPEAKER 3," I love those fucking boys. Oh, the great. Every single person who like  Connor in touched on his trip here, when he left, they all like to me, we're like,  that Connor guy's really cool. All of them individually said that. Yeah, he's got kind eyes.  I've never had that effect on any group of people in my life. Yeah, because you got bitch eyes.  You're a lean old bitch. You are a little bitch. I was hoping you guys would like, "
270,0:22:12,0:22:21,SPEAKER 2," we know this problem. We have a panic. You've met a human and then pretended  you were Nathan stands for two hours. No, that's based. Shut up. Again, you come in, "
271,0:22:21,0:22:26,SPEAKER 4," just holding a torch that is an L. No, it's a flaming L. And that's what you're doing. "
272,0:22:26,0:22:30,SPEAKER 2, It's cool for you to let him be based. The person will never let him get in a ratchet. 
273,0:22:30,0:22:39,SPEAKER 4," Yay. That was great meeting me. What kind of people are we fucking with, bro?  Streamers. Who aren't people? It's not a streamer. She's a YouTuber. Who, Michelle Carr? "
274,0:22:39,0:22:48,SPEAKER 3," Well, no, she's different. We told her. No, she's based because she owned me, which cancels out.  It's like, it's Pemdos, but before that, it was the dude who worked at that "
275,0:22:48,0:22:51,SPEAKER 2, credit card. You'll never be as cool as Connor. That's fair. I'll take that. 
276,0:22:51,0:23:00,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, but what I'm saying is he, Connor is a capybara and you are like a commoto dragon.  You're cute sometimes, but mostly you have poison in your mouth. No, yeah. "
277,0:23:00,0:23:06,SPEAKER 1," That also means he's going to eat Connor. No, not a capybara. No one eats capybara. "
278,0:23:06,0:23:14,SPEAKER 2, Can you pull up a video? Can we see this picture? This is after the Biro card event.  Mango and I had each eight beers over the course of three hours. Then he drank that. 
279,0:23:15,0:23:19,SPEAKER 4," Oh, why didn't they finish my beer? Yeah, Mango is built to last. "
280,0:23:19,0:23:22,SPEAKER 2, He's built Ford. You can just say his liver is failing. 
281,0:23:23,0:23:47,SPEAKER 3," No, don't make me say that. Mango came up to me at the Biro thing and he  like hits my arm and he's like, let's get matching tattoos in Australia.  And it was the most touching thing that's ever happened to me.  That's adorable. That we're doing that. Oh, he made a rule.  So instead of doing matching now, he's going to pick mine and I'm going to pick his.  And they have to be one of you has to approve them. So like matching swastikas. "
282,0:23:48,0:23:49,SPEAKER 1, Yay. 
283,0:23:49,0:23:50,SPEAKER 4, Imagine if we all plan that. 
284,0:23:50,0:23:53,SPEAKER 3, The approval process was to avoid a prank. 
285,0:23:54,0:23:57,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, that would be. I would be really funny. That'd be bad. "
286,0:23:58,0:24:01,SPEAKER 3, So you're supposed to have you're supposed to avoid me getting something like that. 
287,0:24:01,0:24:05,SPEAKER 4, That's why we include. Why am I supposed to make your tattoo better? 
288,0:24:05,0:24:07,SPEAKER 1, Maybe just remove him from the committee on this one. 
289,0:24:07,0:24:09,SPEAKER 3," Well, Mango is the one who picked him. "
290,0:24:10,0:24:12,SPEAKER 2," Oh, I get to do it. He picked slime by name. "
291,0:24:12,0:24:14,SPEAKER 3," No, he was like slime and Ludwig can approve for us. "
292,0:24:14,0:24:16,SPEAKER 2, So he loved how he did. 
293,0:24:16,0:24:18,SPEAKER 1," Oh, yes.  Yeah, "
294,0:24:18,0:24:20,SPEAKER 4, both in the house. He's calling him Austin. 
295,0:24:20,0:24:22,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, I think he quite knows. "
296,0:24:22,0:24:23,SPEAKER 4, That's really funny. 
297,0:24:23,0:24:26,SPEAKER 3, Mango also Aiden and a Mario Kart money match right after it. 
298,0:24:26,0:24:27,SPEAKER 2, It was over soul man. 
299,0:24:27,0:24:29,SPEAKER 1," In double that.  Yeah, money match me. "
300,0:24:29,0:24:30,SPEAKER 2, Aiden was soul mad. 
301,0:24:30,0:24:30,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
302,0:24:30,0:24:32,SPEAKER 4, It was a pride match. 
303,0:24:32,0:24:32,SPEAKER 3, It was a pride match. 
304,0:24:32,0:24:41,SPEAKER 4," Dude, I was with shake in Vegas.  And he was saying Aiden was getting mad at him.  And in melee because of Aiden's mouth.  And I'm like, that guy's just easy to get to. "
305,0:24:41,0:24:46,SPEAKER 2," Dude, bro, I wouldn't say it was mad.  I was there for that, but it was passionate.  Certainly. "
306,0:24:46,0:24:49,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, I wanted to win, but I did. "
307,0:24:49,0:24:55,SPEAKER 4," And I did.  Oh, he's like, I just got a fucking get back in the road.  Got to be Aiden's mouth.  And I'm like, you go girl. "
308,0:24:56,0:25:04,SPEAKER 1," The mango thing was one of the first times where a bunch of people  was saying I was bad, but I was it, which is rare. "
309,0:25:04,0:25:08,SPEAKER 2," It was you were mad because right after you lost,  you said, best of five, five hundred dollars. "
310,0:25:08,0:25:09,SPEAKER 1, Which is mad. 
311,0:25:09,0:25:09,SPEAKER 4, That's so bad. 
312,0:25:09,0:25:10,SPEAKER 1, I'll call that man salty. 
313,0:25:10,0:25:11,SPEAKER 3, I'll call it salty not mad. 
314,0:25:11,0:25:13,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, sure.  Yeah, that's mad. "
315,0:25:14,0:25:14,SPEAKER 1, Is it? 
316,0:25:14,0:25:16,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, it's not happy. "
317,0:25:17,0:25:22,SPEAKER 1, Why don't I be happy?  You're right.  I think we're done here. 
318,0:25:22,0:25:23,SPEAKER 4, I think we're done here. 
319,0:25:24,0:25:25,SPEAKER 2, What is germacinine coffee? 
320,0:25:27,0:25:47,SPEAKER 1," This is right at the beginning.  Right at the beginning of barrio cart.  Gerber comes in.  Everybody's kind of mingling, getting food and stuff.  And around the C9 studio that we used,  they have all their trophies from their different esports accomplishments.  So the e-league Boston Major CSGO trophy, it's there. "
321,0:25:47,0:25:48,SPEAKER 2, Dude. 
322,0:25:48,0:25:48,SPEAKER 1, It's just chilling. 
323,0:25:48,0:25:50,SPEAKER 2, We should pit a lick. 
324,0:25:51,0:25:52,SPEAKER 1, Through Cassidy. 
325,0:25:52,0:25:59,SPEAKER 3," Cassidy was touching it like it was his kid.  He was touching it and he's just like,  man, this thing is so cool.  And I'm like, you're always here. "
326,0:26:01,0:26:20,SPEAKER 1, Is that every day?  That's kind of how I felt though.  I was like scared to touch it.  And they have all their league trophies there.  They're Halo one and there's one more.  It looks really cool.  There's a Rocket League one that kind of has this like the ball from Rocket League  sitting in kind of a... 
327,0:26:20,0:26:21,SPEAKER 2, Just a soccer ball. 
328,0:26:21,0:26:26,SPEAKER 1," Like a long...  Well, it's like a big metal ball. "
329,0:26:27,0:26:28,SPEAKER 4," No, it's the Rocket League ball. "
330,0:26:28,0:26:30,SPEAKER 3, There's the Rocket Ball on the Rocket Course. 
331,0:26:30,0:26:32,SPEAKER 2," Guys, it was Rocket League.  Two Rocket Balls. "
332,0:26:32,0:26:40,SPEAKER 4," Oh, that's from Rocket League, that ball.  That's crazy.  I didn't know they made them so tiny. "
333,0:26:42,0:26:44,SPEAKER 1, Does that every ball is soccer ball to you? 
334,0:26:45,0:26:47,SPEAKER 4," No, no, it's a football. "
335,0:26:47,0:26:47,SPEAKER 3, Am I kicking it? 
336,0:26:49,0:26:51,SPEAKER 1, Are the cars kicking it? 
337,0:26:51,0:26:55,SPEAKER 4, That's a good question.  Are the cars kicking it or are they bumping it with their noses? 
338,0:26:55,0:26:56,SPEAKER 2, Here's a question. 
339,0:26:56,0:26:57,SPEAKER 1, Why don't we call it a volleyball? 
340,0:26:57,0:27:04,SPEAKER 2," Are the Rocket League cars controlled by humans  or are they sentient like cars?  And if they are sentient like the movie cars,  do they fuck each other in Rocket League? "
341,0:27:04,0:27:06,SPEAKER 4," Also, if they explode, do they die? "
342,0:27:06,0:27:07,SPEAKER 1, Hmm. 
343,0:27:07,0:27:10,SPEAKER 3," Well, what happens to the drivers? "
344,0:27:10,0:27:20,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, well, okay, are they being controlled from outside  by humans?  Like, maybe that's the meta.  Maybe it's like a meta commentary  like we are the player controlling the car. "
345,0:27:20,0:27:28,SPEAKER 2," Arcane, but it's just like for Rocket League  and it's just cars for.  And they all think it's just lighting the Queen.  He's like, yeah, I'm in a soccer now. "
346,0:27:28,0:27:37,SPEAKER 4," It's like, I'm in a earpiece and it's like  at the riot like keynote and it's like, what's up?  So we're doing cars.  Yeah, we thought it'd be cool. "
347,0:27:37,0:27:39,SPEAKER 3," Dude, a car's anime would go hard. "
348,0:27:39,0:27:43,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, that actually would go hard.  Anyway, go back to what you're fucking talking about. "
349,0:27:43,0:27:44,SPEAKER 1, What is happening? 
350,0:27:44,0:27:48,SPEAKER 4," Sorry, we're trying to unravel the mysteries of man. "
351,0:27:48,0:27:48,SPEAKER 2, We're shopping. 
352,0:27:48,0:28:14,SPEAKER 1," Right.  But, Jerma, Jerma also trying to unravel  the mysteries of man in his day to day.  Sees this trophy that is the Rocket League trophy  with the ball sitting in it on top  and he has a coffee cup and he goes towards it  and he like taps it a second and then he comes back  and I'm looking at him like, what's happening?  And he looks at me and he's just like,  I thought that was a coffee maker. "
353,0:28:17,0:28:22,SPEAKER 4," Dude, the way Jerma says that too  because he's just like, so matter of fact,  I thought it was a coffee maker. "
354,0:28:23,0:28:25,SPEAKER 2," Dude, he's a psychopath. "
355,0:28:25,0:28:26,SPEAKER 1, He's got it. 
356,0:28:26,0:28:40,SPEAKER 2," He's so funny.  I went to dinner with him after the Vegas event  because I was just in Vegas for a league event.  And he had ordered food, we're at this restaurant.  Steak, claskin, crab, claskin, lobster.  All the fucking foods. "
357,0:28:40,0:28:42,SPEAKER 4," Classy, suppose.  And then it's the end of Rugrats. "
358,0:28:42,0:29:12,SPEAKER 2," He ordered like Alaskan King crab in lobster biz  and a bunch of food and at the end of the dinner  he goes, oh, bread.  And he just realized there was like bread  that they give at the start and he like reaches over for it  and he was doing this thing and I stared at him do this  for 20 minutes uninterrupted.  He'd pick a piece of bread, he'd rip off a small piece  and there was a butter tray.  He would scoop the butter and then use it as a knife  to spread on his bread.  And every time he would get a new piece  he'd be like, wow, this is great.  And you'd eat the whole piece.  He went through four pieces doing that. "
359,0:29:12,0:29:15,SPEAKER 3, He starts making little bread rings  and eating them off his fingers. 
360,0:29:15,0:29:17,SPEAKER 4, Was he being genuine? 
361,0:29:17,0:29:42,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, yeah, no one is looking at him except for me  and we're just, we're engaged in conversation.  And the dinner is over.  People have had a lot of food, everyone is full  but he's reaching very far to this bread  that's in the center to do this  and eventually I cut it and I'm like,  and I just grab it and I'm like, just take the butter out.  And he gets really embarrassed and I'm like,  you're using it as like a small knife.  He's like, what are you looking at me?  I'm doing it this delicious bread. "
362,0:29:43,0:30:07,SPEAKER 4," That is fucking great.  He was the same thing at the Shroomer Awards with coloring book.  Yeah, he not only was he just coloring.  He was like making cute.  He was pretending he was a psychopath.  He's like, I draw the sun now and then he drew his sun  in with a crayon and I was like, this guy's not,  well, at the time I was like, he's doing this for the bit.  That's great.  But now he, what do we get revealed to me  that Jeremy's just an insane guy? "
363,0:30:07,0:30:12,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, he's an insane human and I wish we could  shroom and show him.  Yeah, yeah, like that if I could "
364,0:30:12,0:30:15,SPEAKER 1," kind of get that himself.  Yeah, well, I'm like, I mean, for real. "
365,0:30:15,0:30:16,SPEAKER 2," I mean, for real. "
366,0:30:16,0:30:20,SPEAKER 4, You want to see Jeremy brushing his teeth  and like singing a little tune while he does. 
367,0:30:20,0:30:21,SPEAKER 1, You would be the man for the job. 
368,0:30:21,0:30:26,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, I want to give Jeremy a 500 milligram edible  and put him in a box. "
369,0:30:26,0:30:30,SPEAKER 4," Oh, so you just want him to see the demons  that created us? "
370,0:30:30,0:30:33,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, the room filled the room with clocks.  Yeah. "
371,0:30:35,0:30:36,SPEAKER 3, That also blood and teeth on them. 
372,0:30:36,0:30:58,SPEAKER 2," You just want to do something.  So I want to actually get a great idea.  I forget who, but they were like League of Legends  content that drives double lift.  He's like, I just want to get a bunch of league players  and then have them do like an in-house match.  All high.  And then we kept going where like maybe you do  like a mushroom version of it.  Then you do like the K-hole money match.  And it's like, this is amazing content. "
373,0:30:58,0:31:04,SPEAKER 4," K-hole five, you five, everyone just like  last hitting in lane until 40 minutes.  Just not interacting with each other. "
374,0:31:04,0:31:09,SPEAKER 2," And just like, they have all gone to their  separate bases and the creepers are finishing the game. "
375,0:31:09,0:31:10,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
376,0:31:12,0:31:16,SPEAKER 4," Okay, well, listen, dude.  Fucking you, you ruined our whole day. "
377,0:31:16,0:31:17,SPEAKER 2, Why? 
378,0:31:17,0:31:18,SPEAKER 1, You missed your flight. 
379,0:31:18,0:31:21,SPEAKER 4," You missed your flight.  You didn't, I think didn't you miss two flights? "
380,0:31:21,0:31:22,SPEAKER 2," No, I missed one. "
381,0:31:22,0:31:23,SPEAKER 1," Okay.  No, you missed two. "
382,0:31:23,0:31:24,SPEAKER 2," No, I missed one. "
383,0:31:24,0:31:26,SPEAKER 3, You missed your PJ to go there. 
384,0:31:26,0:31:28,SPEAKER 2," No, no, the PJ would have arrived later. "
385,0:31:28,0:31:30,SPEAKER 1," No, but you made the PJ wait for you. "
386,0:31:31,0:31:32,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, well, that's what PJ does. "
387,0:31:32,0:31:34,SPEAKER 1," No, no, that's correct. "
388,0:31:34,0:31:36,SPEAKER 2, Why did you do that? 
389,0:31:36,0:31:37,SPEAKER 1, Why did you do that? 
390,0:31:37,0:31:49,SPEAKER 2," Here's the first thing.  The first thing was the PJ there.  And it was leaving really early in the morning.  And so I just wanted to do a later flight  because I was supposed to be there at four for the event.  And I was like, yeah, if I get there by like two,  I'll be fine. "
391,0:31:49,0:31:50,SPEAKER 3," And it was leaving at 10, right? "
392,0:31:50,0:31:52,SPEAKER 2, It was leaving at nine. 
393,0:31:52,0:31:53,SPEAKER 4, And the morning and the four. 
394,0:31:53,0:31:55,SPEAKER 3, I hope I call that really early for a flight. 
395,0:31:55,0:31:58,SPEAKER 2, I think it's early because we would arrive by 10  to be there by two. 
396,0:31:59,0:32:01,SPEAKER 4, You're sitting there for four hours. 
397,0:32:01,0:32:07,SPEAKER 2, So I just ended up happening as we got there.  My hotel wasn't even ready.  And then they just ushered us to the thing. 
398,0:32:07,0:32:13,SPEAKER 4," Oh no, King Ludwig's hotel wasn't ready for his jacuzzi  and his fish slippers. "
399,0:32:13,0:32:25,SPEAKER 2," Amazon Crown is the one who created this event.  They were paid like fucking three to five million dollars.  I got paid 10k, which is what everyone else got paid.  They had the bread. "
400,0:32:25,0:32:38,SPEAKER 4," They could have had a lot of it got paid $10,000  to play video games with other famous people and Ms. Kiff.  That's crazy.  Wow, wow, poor little U bears, poor little guy. "
401,0:32:38,0:32:39,SPEAKER 2, You bring up a really good point slime. 
402,0:32:40,0:32:47,SPEAKER 4," It'll be okay.  Hey, you know what, you're right, you had a tough one  and I should have noticed that I'm sorry.  Yeah, I'm sorry. "
403,0:32:47,0:32:51,SPEAKER 2, I'm excited to spend the 10k repairing drywall  and getting a floor cleaned. 
404,0:32:52,0:32:53,SPEAKER 1, I cleaned the floor. 
405,0:32:53,0:32:55,SPEAKER 2, It's cleaner than before. 
406,0:32:55,0:33:00,SPEAKER 4," And it smells good.  It smells like flowers too.  Also, you bitch. "
407,0:33:00,0:33:03,SPEAKER 1, I doubled up in the wrong order. 
408,0:33:03,0:33:10,SPEAKER 4," You were, you were an Owen.  That was gross.  I was embarrassed.  I was like, that's my friend.  I need him to do better. "
409,0:33:10,0:33:25,SPEAKER 2," So we did the league event.  It was like a show match and it was,  it was double lift Tyler won on one squad.  And then the other squad had Yasuo and Voidboy.  Yasuo has quit playing league of legends  to gamble full time in Mexico.  He's a multi-multi-multi-multi-millionaire. "
410,0:33:25,0:33:27,SPEAKER 1, Why didn't they split them up? 
411,0:33:27,0:33:45,SPEAKER 2," And then, Voidboy took a mental break a year ago  and he's barely played league.  Like he started like a month ago.  Seating was insane.  I met the guy with Seating.  There never was like, you're dumb.  You're dumb, you're dumb.  And everyone expected my team to win.  And like the melee comparative is like,  it's fucking like mango in Zane on a team.  And then like, I don't know.  Cadoran and Aiden. "
412,0:33:45,0:33:48,SPEAKER 4," And hey, hey, don't fuck around. "
413,0:33:48,0:33:51,SPEAKER 1," And to be fair, Cadoran and Aiden  beats a lot of the other teams. "
414,0:33:51,0:33:52,SPEAKER 2, So the whole time? 
415,0:33:52,0:33:53,SPEAKER 1, Just not the best. 
416,0:33:53,0:33:57,SPEAKER 4," I usually I don't give him this, but god damn right.  Let's go. "
417,0:33:57,0:34:16,SPEAKER 2," The whole time we're in the pre-game room  and like I am the worst one at the event.  I am level 18 and just for everyone who doesn't play league,  you have to be level 30 to play ranked.  So I am not even a high enough level to play ranked.  I have to play unrated or against bots.  That's the only experience.  I played maybe 30 games in my life.  Into prep, I played three games with cutie. "
418,0:34:16,0:34:19,SPEAKER 4, It was very cute.  The night before they're just queuing together. 
419,0:34:19,0:34:28,SPEAKER 3," I can hear it coming through his headset.  Like, oh, good job, babe.  And then I leaned over to him and I said,  you're the only person playing league  that just heard that through their headset. "
420,0:34:28,0:34:29,SPEAKER 2, Can you strike so hard? 
421,0:34:30,0:34:32,SPEAKER 4, I was usually trying to carry your dumbass. 
422,0:34:32,0:35:12,SPEAKER 2," Well, no, just to be nice to me,  because I think every fiber in her body wanted to flame me.  And if I was not her boyfriend,  she would have been like, you are fucking throwing this game.  But she didn't do that.  She was like, you're doing great.  If I went one for 10 on hitting thresholds.  And that was all my prep.  But I was feeling really confident  because we were in the green room  and it's my whole team,  which was Ninja, Tyler, one,  double lift, a sap nap in myself.  And everyone's like, yeah, we're going to crush game one.  We're going to probably throw game two  so we can get a game three in there  and they're talking all this mess.  And I'm just in the backpack.  I'm Sora.  And I'm like, I'm like, okay, that sounds great.  And we get to our first game.  And we get kind of... "
423,0:35:12,0:35:16,SPEAKER 4, You were in Owen.  You ended Owen in the top 12. 
424,0:35:16,0:35:18,SPEAKER 2," We get kind of...  No, I didn't go on 12. "
425,0:35:18,0:35:19,SPEAKER 4, In the first game? 
426,0:35:19,0:35:22,SPEAKER 2," No.  First of all, Owen is not a bad thing when we were support. "
427,0:35:22,0:35:27,SPEAKER 4, I played thousands of hours in Dota.  I understand what that means.  But you still were in Owen. 
428,0:35:27,0:35:28,SPEAKER 2, I was 099. 
429,0:35:28,0:35:30,SPEAKER 3, Some girls prefer Owen. 
430,0:35:30,0:35:31,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
431,0:35:31,0:35:33,SPEAKER 4," Well, that makes me cool. "
432,0:35:34,0:35:35,SPEAKER 2, So we get stopped. 
433,0:35:35,0:35:36,SPEAKER 3, I'm like a grease statue. 
434,0:35:36,0:35:57,SPEAKER 2," And I just, I realized through the event,  Tyler won and double lift are so good at league  that they're so out of touch with people who are bad.  Because they're like talking about me while I'm there.  Like I'm not there.  They're like, okay, maybe he plays Yumi.  And then Tyler's like, there's no way he could do Yumi's  auto-cancel, alt.  And then double lifts like, yeah, you're right, he couldn't.  And they're going through characters. "
435,0:35:57,0:35:58,SPEAKER 1, Who could you? 
436,0:35:58,0:36:01,SPEAKER 2, I don't fucking know what they're talking about.  I know like eight characters. 
437,0:36:01,0:36:02,SPEAKER 3, That's why they're doing this. 
438,0:36:02,0:36:18,SPEAKER 2," And they're going through it all and they're like,  well, maybe he plays like Soraka.  And then they're like, yes, Soraka's brain dead.  Even a dog could play Soraka.  And then they're like, fine.  And so it's like a double of sex means he's like here.  And he sets up and he's like, this is Soraka.  She heals. "
439,0:36:18,0:36:19,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, yeah. "
440,0:36:19,0:36:23,SPEAKER 4, This is all part for the course when we did a battle pass.  Five other teams. 
441,0:36:23,0:36:39,SPEAKER 2," And so I learned Soraka in maybe 30 seconds before we had to play again.  We boot in.  And I don't know how the fuck to play this character.  And after like, I'm trying my best.  So like, after I die or something in a fight,  I'm like, what could I have done better?  And then Tyler's like, anything. "
442,0:36:40,0:36:42,SPEAKER 4," Dude, that is so funny. "
443,0:36:42,0:37:39,SPEAKER 2," And I'm like, bet bet.  And the whole time, I'm confused because I'm like,  why am I the variable, right?  There are amazing players on my team.  Miss Kiff is on their team.  He's about as bad as me.  And he's in the backpack.  Why can't I just be in the backpack?  Why am I the difference maker for a league win?  And then they realize they're like, okay, wait.  Support is probably the most important role.  Why are we having Ludwig do it?  Put him in the jungle.  Have him roam around in the camps.  Don't do shit all, right?  And so game three, this is what happens.  We lost the first two games as the best of three.  It's supposed to be over.  I go to Ninja, I say, because I'm kind of mad.  Because I'm like, this is embarrassing.  I say, hey, offer a $50,000 last second third match  that all goes to charity.  I'll pay for half of it if we lose.  And then just like, all right.  So he does it.  They accept.  And we have a new strat, which is, I'll just do it.  Miss Kiff does.  I just jungle.  And it was fucking easy.  We won.  We crushed.  It wasn't close. "
444,0:37:39,0:37:40,SPEAKER 1, Wow. 
445,0:37:40,0:37:43,SPEAKER 2, And that was it.  I was just able to sit in the backpack.  And it was a joy of something. 
446,0:37:43,0:37:44,SPEAKER 1," So they didn't, you're also them. "
447,0:37:44,0:37:47,SPEAKER 4, They didn't work around you being shit. 
448,0:37:47,0:37:48,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, they were just dumb. "
449,0:37:48,0:37:50,SPEAKER 4," Like they just, I know that yeah, they were dumb. "
450,0:37:50,0:37:51,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, they okay. "
451,0:37:51,0:37:59,SPEAKER 2," Tyler one has played 4,000 hours of league in the past two years.  If he has not recognized that I should not be playing support.  I could not have. "
452,0:37:59,0:38:00,SPEAKER 4, Interesting. 
453,0:38:00,0:38:04,SPEAKER 2, I'm not the guy who steps on the goes.  You know what guys?  I think I should switch to jungle. 
454,0:38:04,0:38:07,SPEAKER 4, Why weren't you on Mr. B's team?  He's your friend. 
455,0:38:07,0:38:13,SPEAKER 1, I think you could have booted up Blitzcrank.  I think you could have landed a couple hooks.  And you've been good. 
456,0:38:13,0:38:16,SPEAKER 2," No, this is, see, this is what they were saying.  It's like you could just figure it out. "
457,0:38:16,0:38:20,SPEAKER 1," Just fate.  Dude, it's a, it's a skillshot.  It's, you point and click. "
458,0:38:20,0:38:37,SPEAKER 2," You don't figure it out on your 31st game of league.  I think but I wasn't on Mr. B's team  because he called me to do this.  He's like, yo, let me do you want to play in my, in my event.  And I was like, sure.  And he's like, how good are you?  I was like, I'm terrible.  I played like 30 games lifetime.  And he's like, okay, I'll put you in Ninja's team.  So you could maybe throw and help me win.  Oh, so he wanted me to be on their team. "
459,0:38:37,0:38:38,SPEAKER 1," Okay, then inside job. "
460,0:38:38,0:38:41,SPEAKER 4, I did wonder that Mr. B's with double lift. 
461,0:38:41,0:38:47,SPEAKER 2," He was no, he was with the boy boy.  He was with the bad team.  That ended up technically winning.  But since we did that third match, there's always, "
462,0:38:48,0:38:49,SPEAKER 4," oh, it's a road game. "
463,0:38:49,0:38:51,SPEAKER 2," It leaves him guessing.  Yeah, we won the road game. "
464,0:38:51,0:38:52,SPEAKER 4, Road game. 
465,0:38:52,0:38:53,SPEAKER 3, That's hustle and a half. 
466,0:38:53,0:38:53,SPEAKER 1, I like that. 
467,0:38:53,0:38:56,SPEAKER 2," Made him pay 50k, which doesn't really hurt his bottom line. "
468,0:38:56,0:39:03,SPEAKER 4," That's pretty cool.  I think that that's okay.  Even though it was fun to make fun of you,  I was happy to see my friend play video games. "
469,0:39:03,0:39:05,SPEAKER 1," What, what happened today? "
470,0:39:06,0:39:15,SPEAKER 2," Well, okay, so then after the event ended,  we went to dinner with the,  it was hard German eat bread weird.  Yeah, I went to, I met Magnus Carlson for the first time. "
471,0:39:15,0:39:17,SPEAKER 1," Oh, you've never met him.  I never. "
472,0:39:17,0:39:18,SPEAKER 3," That was a big deal for you, right? "
473,0:39:18,0:39:26,SPEAKER 2," It was, yeah, so they were doing a poker game for 20k.  Originally, I was supposed to do it,  but I didn't realize it was streamed.  I was pretty fucking out of it.  And I didn't have 20k cash. "
474,0:39:26,0:39:27,SPEAKER 3, Stream kind of sucked. 
475,0:39:27,0:39:29,SPEAKER 2, I heard he had a shit ton of tech problems. 
476,0:39:29,0:39:30,SPEAKER 3," Dude, there was no one. "
477,0:39:30,0:39:32,SPEAKER 4, There was no audience awful.  Yeah. Oh gross. 
478,0:39:32,0:39:46,SPEAKER 2," They, so they, they start off the stream.  They didn't realize there's no audio  and there's a 15 minute delay.  So they waited 15 minutes of doing the stream  and then child was like, no audio.  On the first 30 seconds of it,  they try to fix it.  50 minutes passed, their fix didn't work. "
479,0:39:46,0:39:47,SPEAKER 3, Yeah. 
480,0:39:47,0:39:49,SPEAKER 2," So it took like 30, 45 minutes  to actually do anything. "
481,0:39:49,0:39:51,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, that's delayed based production. "
482,0:39:51,0:39:54,SPEAKER 3," We clicked out to be said,  this is the bad thing we left. "
483,0:39:54,0:39:56,SPEAKER 1, So they were watching it and left. 
484,0:39:56,0:40:01,SPEAKER 3, And we still want a respect for production.  So I can imagine children all just left. 
485,0:40:01,0:40:02,SPEAKER 1," Oh, yeah, yeah. "
486,0:40:02,0:40:02,SPEAKER 3, With no thought. 
487,0:40:02,0:40:06,SPEAKER 2," They were molding.  It was a bummer for about 10,  because I think there was like,  it would have been cool. "
488,0:40:06,0:40:09,SPEAKER 4, They should have taken the phones and no delay.  What are they doing? 
489,0:40:09,0:40:10,SPEAKER 1, Either way. 
490,0:40:10,0:40:14,SPEAKER 2, But I met Magnus.  He was very cool.  Apparently he was nervous to meet me before I went to. 
491,0:40:14,0:40:18,SPEAKER 4," Did he say his name like Magnus?  Like, what is that?  I'm Magnus. "
492,0:40:18,0:40:19,SPEAKER 3, And why would he say it that way? 
493,0:40:19,0:40:20,SPEAKER 1, I would say it that way. 
494,0:40:20,0:40:24,SPEAKER 4," That's how the guy who's named that in dark, the show. "
495,0:40:24,0:40:27,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, but they're German and he's Norwegian.  Yeah, it's different. "
496,0:40:27,0:40:31,SPEAKER 4," What is the, is it different countries?  Where's Norway differently? "
497,0:40:31,0:40:33,SPEAKER 2," Okay, he's Norge. "
498,0:40:33,0:40:42,SPEAKER 4," And oh, Norge.  Okay.  Oh, I love those guys.  Shout out, shout out, shout out, length plank. "
499,0:40:42,0:40:45,SPEAKER 1, And hanky.  Hanky. 
500,0:40:45,0:40:53,SPEAKER 2," I met him.  It was tight.  The only thing and the reason I am late here today,  and I missed my flight, it's because I stayed up late,  gambling with Mr. Beast. "
501,0:40:53,0:40:55,SPEAKER 3," That's why, which is crazy. "
502,0:40:55,0:40:56,SPEAKER 4, Is he crazy? 
503,0:40:56,0:40:57,SPEAKER 1, I can only imagine. 
504,0:40:57,0:40:58,SPEAKER 2, It's fucking psychopath. 
505,0:40:58,0:40:59,SPEAKER 3, That's awesome. 
506,0:40:59,0:41:10,SPEAKER 2," It is at like the high roller roulette table  and he has like $100,000 in chips in front of him.  He had one 200K off a single roulette hand.  And, yeah. "
507,0:41:10,0:41:12,SPEAKER 4," Me and him are, we're cut from the same point. "
508,0:41:12,0:41:13,SPEAKER 2, If you play any insult from the same point. 
509,0:41:13,0:41:19,SPEAKER 4," Yes, we are.  He just has more money than me.  I was in Vegas days before.  Don't you get that? "
510,0:41:19,0:41:21,SPEAKER 2, That's still a lot of people were. 
511,0:41:21,0:41:26,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, but I went up 25 grand.  I took fucking Bellagio for a ride, bro. "
512,0:41:26,0:41:28,SPEAKER 1," And then, wait, what did you leave with? "
513,0:41:28,0:41:33,SPEAKER 4, I'm still up.  I was a good boy.  How much are you up?  I'm up 25 grand. 
514,0:41:33,0:41:33,SPEAKER 1, Whoa. 
515,0:41:33,0:41:35,SPEAKER 4, Yeah.  This is never happening. 
516,0:41:35,0:41:37,SPEAKER 3, This is never happening.  It almost never happens this way. 
517,0:41:37,0:41:44,SPEAKER 4, It almost never happens.  That's why I was so happy.  I literally walked by the fountain  and he'll pick up Shake Drizzle listening to fucking  the Bellagio episode. 
518,0:41:44,0:41:48,SPEAKER 3," The Bellagio was like,  hey, that ball guy's barring some of the money  we're keeping from him. "
519,0:41:48,0:42:07,SPEAKER 4," They let me, they put me on ice  because I went back with Shake Drizzle.  I was up 15K and I'm like, this is great.  I take another three and I'm like,  all right, Shake, let's teach you some blackjack.  We go to the Bellagio.  I fucking, I run up that three to another 10  and I'm like, this is too good.  Shake, we need to get, we need to scram.  Like, this could be due. "
520,0:42:07,0:42:10,SPEAKER 1," Meanwhile, Shake's between the house always wins on his time. "
521,0:42:10,0:42:27,SPEAKER 4," I told him, I told him, you will lose  and I go back to the cage and they make me wait.  They're like, we haven't approved your win yet.  I'm like, what?  Like, yeah, you were just there, right?  I'm like, yeah, and they were like, okay.  And they maybe sit there.  And I'm like, Shake, they're gonna follow us around.  We gotta get out of here.  But they gave me the money eventually.  But they don't like when you beat him up like that. "
522,0:42:27,0:42:28,SPEAKER 2, They don't. 
523,0:42:28,0:42:30,SPEAKER 4," Anyway, did Jimmy beat him up? "
524,0:42:30,0:42:33,SPEAKER 2," So he was beating him up.  He wrote it from 10K to like, 250K. "
525,0:42:33,0:42:35,SPEAKER 1, My bitch.  Does Jimmy beat it up? 
526,0:42:36,0:42:38,SPEAKER 3, Is Jimmy making a clap in the casino? 
527,0:42:38,0:42:39,SPEAKER 1, He's making a clap. 
528,0:42:39,0:42:41,SPEAKER 4, He's giving them back shots and the fuck? 
529,0:42:41,0:42:48,SPEAKER 1," Oh, no, no.  No, no.  I don't know.  Oh, no, no, no.  You don't know.  Do you think Jimmy knows it makes a sound?  That's it. "
530,0:42:50,0:42:55,SPEAKER 2," Well, he has his hose doing his work form  and his hose is me and like, sap nap.  Okay. "
531,0:42:55,0:43:01,SPEAKER 1, He has sap nap.  Imagine how many people in this world  can make Ludwig and sap nap the hose. 
532,0:43:01,0:43:25,SPEAKER 2," This was sap nap's job.  Sap nap was sitting on the far left  actually met him in puns.  And since Mr. Beast was playing like all over,  he'd play like, oh, I'm gonna go right this time  and then play a bunch of random numbers on the inside.  He was playing zero and one turn he didn't play zero  and it hit and he was really mad.  Cause he was going to do it in and Dealer was like,  no, no, no.  So then he went to like, like sap nap  and he was like, you have to put this $500 chip  on zero every single turn. "
533,0:43:25,0:43:26,SPEAKER 1," And every time he gave me a job, "
534,0:43:26,0:43:31,SPEAKER 2," he didn't do that.  And if he was ever late, Mr. Beast would be like,  do your job and he'd be like, "
535,0:43:31,0:43:36,SPEAKER 4," he said, hey, sell this tomato sauce  and your little wagon on the streets.  Yeah, little boy. "
536,0:43:36,0:43:52,SPEAKER 2," I walk in and I'm like, I'm like,  I see there was three reds and I'm like,  shmish mop, I put like all my money  of like $500.  I put it on black and Mr. Beast's like,  oh, Lutty, you seem like you know what you're doing.  And I was like, yeah, he puts like 50k there. "
537,0:43:52,0:43:58,SPEAKER 4," And I'm like, oh, it was the same, bro.  If I had his money, we'd be the same,  but I'd be broke and he'd still be rich. "
538,0:43:58,0:44:40,SPEAKER 2," In a hits and he's like, and he's like, wow,  you know what you're doing.  I'm following you next.  And then I'm like, oh, okay, this is stressful.  And so I'm like, red and he puts like, you know,  like 20k whenever it is in a hits.  And he's like, wow, you're really good.  And then he starts paying me out.  And he's like, I'm gonna give you 1% of all my winnings.  And I'm like, this is a tight gig.  This could go well pretty quickly.  And he gives me like, whatever, 500 bucks.  And I start playing.  And I do good for like a couple others.  And I say out loud, I'm like,  I think I only got two more in me.  You know, I can only be lucky for so long.  And I go like the wrong color.  And he's like, ooh, didn't love that from you.  And I was like, okay, well, I'll bring it back to you. "
539,0:44:40,0:44:42,SPEAKER 3, Daddy is not pleased with you. 
540,0:44:42,0:45:06,SPEAKER 2," And I go black again.  And it misses again.  He's like, wow.  And then he's like, you know what?  I think I'm gonna go the opposite  from what you do from now on.  And he starts doing that.  And then he starts winning.  And he's laughing in my face  as I'm losing like hundreds of dollars.  And he's winning thousands of dollars.  The whole time, by the way, he has this giant  like six, five security guard.  Great guy, sweet lad. "
541,0:45:06,0:45:07,SPEAKER 4, He's the same guy from the poker. 
542,0:45:07,0:45:23,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, yeah, he's doing this.  I told his mom I'd bring back some money.  And he's just, he's like, he's like, Jimmy,  maybe I take someone we bring it up to hotel.  And he was like, no, that's all right.  Can you call this guy like Chuck  and tell him to bring more money?  He's like, no, no. "
543,0:45:23,0:45:35,SPEAKER 4," I remember we asked him when we were  cashing out after the poker game  because it took forever.  And it was me Ludwig and that guy.  And we're just like, you get used to it, huh?  And he's just like, oh yeah.  He was very cool. "
544,0:45:35,0:46:34,SPEAKER 3," I was just in Vegas in my brother.  And I can't remember, I don't think I said this  in the podcast, but we're playing Pygo.  He's never played before.  He's very excited to learn this new game.  He's also wasted.  And he's also the luckiest gambler of all time.  And we're sitting there, I am down three grand,  which is the most I've ever been down in Vegas.  And so I'm like, damn, I can't gamble anymore.  I don't want to play anymore games.  So I'm just sitting with him while he plays Pygo  and I'm watching.  And he goes, hey, hey, he hands me like a hundred bucks  in chips.  He's like, just play, just play, you keep half, keep half.  And I was like, okay, usually when he gambles  some money, he's put the winnings or whatever.  So I'm playing.  And you know when you're at like a black tech table  or a Pygo table, there's like the progressive screen  and you just don't even look up there.  You never fucking win it.  Yeah, so I hit a progressive one on my Pygo hand.  I won $1,000 off of a $15 bet.  It was.  I have, I got a straight flush in Pygo.  I've literally never, ever gotten on the progressive screen.  And my drunk brother pops off. "
545,0:46:34,0:46:36,SPEAKER 1," He's like, what's fucking go? "
546,0:46:36,0:46:53,SPEAKER 3," Gets up, he's hogging me, he's just saying shit to everyone.  And then he takes the money and he scoops it all back in.  And then he just puts it in his bag.  And now I no longer have money, I good work.  And I'm not gonna tell him give me your money,  but we had this kind of agreement  that I was keeping half of whatever I won gambling for. "
547,0:46:53,0:46:55,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, well the agreement changed. "
548,0:46:55,0:47:14,SPEAKER 3," So he changed it.  And then later, after we're done playing Pygo,  he goes, where's all the money you want?  And I'm like, I gave it back to you.  He goes, oh, I wanted you to keep half.  And I was like, oh, and then he just didn't give me any.  And I was like, I wasted all my luck  on that fucking moment. "
549,0:47:14,0:47:16,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, and he stole your luck.  And now he's like, when I got to give it to someone, "
550,0:47:16,0:47:17,SPEAKER 1," it's stolen, it's all gone. "
551,0:47:17,0:47:36,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, that'll happen.  Look, Vegas take it the way.  I hope Shakey D right now, at this very moment,  right now this is a Sunday we're recording this.  Shakey D is not out of Vegas yet.  Oh no.  He's up like $1,000 off a chip.  I gave him, and I don't want it back,  but I want him to go up and I want him to stay up.  And I don't think he's going to. "
552,0:47:36,0:47:37,SPEAKER 3, I don't think he's going to. 
553,0:47:37,0:48:04,SPEAKER 1," He teamed with a June Bug at Double Down.  And June Bug for people who don't know,  was a really, really good project employer still is.  And also a very good melee player played chic.  But June Bug went to this tournament  and played only Dr. Mario the entire weekend  and teamed with Shake Drizzle.  And in singles, June Bug made a run  to get into top 12 of this major tournament  with only doc, which is a bad character. "
554,0:48:04,0:48:07,SPEAKER 3, A character that he's only playing  for a fun YouTube video he's making. 
555,0:48:07,0:48:19,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.  And he skipped out on his top 12 qualifier match  to play on Sunday and finals to go see Shin Lim.  The magician. 
556,0:48:19,0:48:20,SPEAKER 2, The goal. 
557,0:48:20,0:48:22,SPEAKER 1, The magician.  Yeah. 
558,0:48:22,0:48:25,SPEAKER 4, He has a really cool billboard and he's doing this 
559,0:48:25,0:48:35,SPEAKER 3," and there's cards and it's all the same.  He's just like tossing his hair, being hot,  but then you start beating off.  And everyone's just like, whoa. "
560,0:48:35,0:48:38,SPEAKER 4, I went to the wrong one. 
561,0:48:38,0:48:38,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
562,0:48:38,0:48:39,SPEAKER 2, Look at that. 
563,0:48:39,0:48:43,SPEAKER 4," Look at that squad.  That's shake, mokey.  What's the name? "
564,0:48:43,0:48:44,SPEAKER 1, Poorhead. 
565,0:48:44,0:48:46,SPEAKER 4, Afghans in the flat. 
566,0:48:46,0:48:49,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.  Dead center.  Yeah. 
567,0:48:49,0:48:51,SPEAKER 4, That is so funny.  Shands on the right. 
568,0:48:51,0:48:53,SPEAKER 1, Not on the right.  Yeah. 
569,0:48:53,0:49:00,SPEAKER 2," That's tight.  I will wait.  Can we talk about the other thing from the tournament,  which is the, you alluded to it?  The H box bio weapon? "
570,0:49:00,0:49:04,SPEAKER 4, There was no illusion.  It was just what happened where H box. 
571,0:49:04,0:49:06,SPEAKER 2, He alluded. 
572,0:49:06,0:49:11,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, yeah.  There was no illusion.  It's still a noun.  But a, there's no illusion. "
573,0:49:11,0:49:13,SPEAKER 2, A looted means you referenced it earlier. 
574,0:49:13,0:49:14,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
575,0:49:14,0:49:15,SPEAKER 2, But there wasn't illusion. 
576,0:49:15,0:49:20,SPEAKER 4," But I didn't, when you allude to something,  I think it means that it hasn't, it's not real. "
577,0:49:20,0:49:22,SPEAKER 2, No.  You're thinking of illusion and you're not. 
578,0:49:22,0:49:24,SPEAKER 4," No, no, no, no, I'm not. "
579,0:49:24,0:49:27,SPEAKER 2," If you allude to someone, it means like you're hunting at it. "
580,0:49:27,0:49:36,SPEAKER 4," I alluded to it, but I didn't covertly, secretly say anything.  I just said, H box has hepatitis, which it doesn't have.  So you're alluding to that. "
581,0:49:37,0:49:39,SPEAKER 2," Well, I don't know that it's hepatitis. "
582,0:49:39,0:49:40,SPEAKER 4, Right. 
583,0:49:40,0:49:42,SPEAKER 2, I'm right about this.  You're a dumb English major.  I don't know the definition of allude. 
584,0:49:42,0:49:43,SPEAKER 1, Pull up the definition of allude. 
585,0:49:43,0:49:45,SPEAKER 4, You want to win?  Pull it up. 
586,0:49:45,0:49:47,SPEAKER 1, He wants to win.  Pull it up. 
587,0:49:47,0:49:54,SPEAKER 4," I love it when he's for sure.  Right.  A lot of way he is right.  Uh, we can't see because of the board.  To call attention to indirectly hint at it.  I didn't hint at anything.  I just said he has it. "
588,0:49:54,0:49:58,SPEAKER 2, You hinted that H box was a bio weapon at this tournament  by saying it's hepatitis. 
589,0:49:58,0:50:05,SPEAKER 1," You're hinting at him having another disease  because you are pretty confident, I presumeably,  that he does not have hepatitis. "
590,0:50:05,0:50:08,SPEAKER 4," OK, someone who actually cares about the English language. "
591,0:50:08,0:50:09,SPEAKER 2, Hold it. 
592,0:50:09,0:50:21,SPEAKER 4," I would argue that it is not that I was being much more  specific than an illusion would be.  Do you understand me?  Now, there's probably some play here.  There's probably a little bit of. "
593,0:50:21,0:50:24,SPEAKER 3, You've got to be some play here.  I'm trying to get some play. 
594,0:50:24,0:50:27,SPEAKER 4, And you can give me some play in the parking lot. 
595,0:50:27,0:50:28,SPEAKER 2, I'm just a smarter English major. 
596,0:50:28,0:50:32,SPEAKER 4," Anyway, I really think that.  Hey, I don't pull up the DM that you  wanted to talk about real quick. "
597,0:50:32,0:50:33,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
598,0:50:33,0:50:35,SPEAKER 4, This is great.  Smart English major. 
599,0:50:35,0:50:38,SPEAKER 1, Another log in Ludwig Texting. 
600,0:50:38,0:50:42,SPEAKER 2, I'm blocking your number.  I just don't want to talk to you.  I just don't care to talk to you. 
601,0:50:42,0:50:44,SPEAKER 4, Why don't you want to be accountable for the words you say? 
602,0:50:44,0:50:49,SPEAKER 1," Talk to the message out loud.  You don't want to be accountable for the message out loud.  When you text me, you don't want to be held accountable. "
603,0:50:49,0:50:50,SPEAKER 2, Talk to me for the tingling. 
604,0:50:50,0:51:19,SPEAKER 1," I want to genuinely know what you were thinking when  you said this text.  I want to know if this was a type of master English major.  This is today at 1240.  Because I understand crazy weekend with Mr. Beast.  You missed your flight.  It happens.  We have to reschedule the time that we were going to record.  So we're kind of trying to reschedule the premium episode  understandable circumstance.  And I, you send me texts about you coming late.  And then I say, "
605,0:51:19,0:51:21,SPEAKER 4, I'm a text agent for some reason who's now job is to message all of us. 
606,0:51:21,0:51:33,SPEAKER 1," I say probably, because you're asking when we do the premium.  And I say probably going to do the premium in Oz.  And then you just reply with, shouldn't  the Australian premium? "
607,0:51:33,0:51:56,SPEAKER 2," No, I said, I didn't say that, that's a lie.  I said, Shindy Australian premium be for the Australian episode.  But then my data cut out and it didn't send until four minutes later.  Which is a complete thought.  Read your text.  No, I know, I just told you you dumbass.  It didn't send to four minutes later because I didn't have data.  So I wrote, shouldn't the Australian premium be for the Australian episode?  Which is a full thought. "
608,0:51:56,0:51:58,SPEAKER 4, Which you're saying is a W. 
609,0:51:58,0:52:13,SPEAKER 1," Data cut out is having one.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  I see, I'm going to choose with the route of understanding here.  You're saying that your data went out in the middle  because you're breaking it up into multiple types  and you're continuing your sentence. "
610,0:52:13,0:52:15,SPEAKER 2, One text shouldn't the Australian premium be for the Australian episode. 
611,0:52:15,0:52:29,SPEAKER 1," Okay, because from my end, these are like five minutes apart, right?  And that's why I was confused because I just got the first part of the text  which said, shouldn't the Australian premium?  And I'm like, does that mean we do it with the episode there? "
612,0:52:29,0:52:31,SPEAKER 4, You sent him in the shadow realm. 
613,0:52:31,0:52:36,SPEAKER 2," It was annoying because I then saw you roasting me in the replies,  but my text wouldn't send back. "
614,0:52:36,0:52:41,SPEAKER 1," I didn't roast you.  I didn't roast you.  I just said, what do you mean?  Is that a roast roast? "
615,0:52:41,0:52:43,SPEAKER 2, Because I didn't roast. 
616,0:52:43,0:52:45,SPEAKER 1, Because I just had to have it. 
617,0:52:45,0:52:48,SPEAKER 2," Well, then you had a segment for the podcast about it. "
618,0:52:48,0:52:50,SPEAKER 4," Well, he wanted to bring it up.  I didn't see his fucking phone. "
619,0:52:50,0:52:52,SPEAKER 2, So this is what I was doing and I was like fucking annoy it. 
620,0:52:52,0:52:56,SPEAKER 1, So this is a very reasonable answer. 
621,0:52:56,0:52:58,SPEAKER 2, This is a very reasonable answer. 
622,0:52:58,0:53:03,SPEAKER 4, Let me tell you something.  What does that mean is not a roast?  It's just trying to get the info. 
623,0:53:03,0:53:10,SPEAKER 2," What does that mean?  And then presumably he was in a group and he was like,  check out this low-toe text and then he sent him a segment for a podcast about it.  I didn't do that. "
624,0:53:10,0:53:12,SPEAKER 1," No, I mean, I'm doing it now.  Yeah. "
625,0:53:12,0:53:16,SPEAKER 4, He said it before you came up because you took seven years to hork down your burrito. 
626,0:53:16,0:53:18,SPEAKER 2, So it did happen. 
627,0:53:18,0:53:32,SPEAKER 1," But no, that's a great explanation because I was surprised by this.  When you sent this first text and it just said that, I was really surprised  because I feel like we've been having some breakthroughs at the communication department  lately. "
628,0:53:32,0:53:37,SPEAKER 4, And I was surprised that you would send a text like that and then he had a stroke and  then touched his phone with his fingers. 
629,0:53:37,0:53:40,SPEAKER 2, Which is what happened.  Vegas is a desert.  It turns out. 
630,0:53:40,0:53:47,SPEAKER 4," Is it what happened?  Also, you were late for a flight when every place you stay in Vegas is three miles from  the airport. "
631,0:53:47,0:54:05,SPEAKER 1," And the whole premise of this conversation is you trying to make sure that something gets  done because of the mistake that you made, which it's like you taking accountability  for it.  So I think the whole circumstance is great.  And I'm not trying to make fun of you.  I just thought that one text was very, very fun. "
632,0:54:05,0:54:12,SPEAKER 2, It was just an overshoot.  I shot for a 9 a.m. flight at Vegas when I was there for one night and I went to bed  at like four. 
633,0:54:12,0:54:13,SPEAKER 4, And you went to sleep at back. 
634,0:54:13,0:54:14,SPEAKER 2, It was just an overshoot. 
635,0:54:14,0:54:18,SPEAKER 4," Yeah.  Sleep at back.  Did you press snooze?  Did you look at your phone and say, I'll get another flight? "
636,0:54:18,0:54:20,SPEAKER 3," I said, I was going to ask. "
637,0:54:20,0:54:27,SPEAKER 2, Why?  I didn't have a phone charger because God's going to wake me up.  Why?  Because I didn't have one.  I didn't pack one.  I didn't have a toothbrush. 
638,0:54:27,0:54:30,SPEAKER 3, I'm brushing my teeth in 48 hours.  I have a question.  Are you packed for Australia? 
639,0:54:30,0:54:31,SPEAKER 2, No. 
640,0:54:31,0:54:32,SPEAKER 1, But he leaves like four days later. 
641,0:54:32,0:54:33,SPEAKER 3," Oh, right. "
642,0:54:33,0:54:34,SPEAKER 1, He leaves with us later. 
643,0:54:34,0:54:37,SPEAKER 3," All right.  Well, Aiden's also not packed.  But he does leave. "
644,0:54:37,0:54:38,SPEAKER 1, What? 
645,0:54:38,0:54:39,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, I'm almost done. "
646,0:54:39,0:54:40,SPEAKER 1, Aiden packed real quick. 
647,0:54:40,0:54:42,SPEAKER 2," Also, I packed fast.  Also, we're going to Australia. "
648,0:54:42,0:54:45,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, we're going to Australia.  Oh, shit.  And then this is up. "
649,0:54:45,0:54:46,SPEAKER 4, We'll be in Australia. 
650,0:54:46,0:54:47,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
651,0:54:47,0:54:48,SPEAKER 3, Wiss up. 
652,0:54:48,0:54:50,SPEAKER 4, Kangas.  Yeah. 
653,0:54:51,0:54:52,SPEAKER 2," Why are you trying to fuck him, Marcy? "
654,0:54:52,0:54:53,SPEAKER 4, He's feeling it. 
655,0:54:53,0:54:57,SPEAKER 1, You just said Kanga.  You just said Kanga with a soft A.  And I feel like that's weird. 
656,0:54:57,0:55:00,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, it's not weird to say it like that. "
657,0:55:00,0:55:04,SPEAKER 3, Any more soup deals wearing blue lemon.  I was feeling I want to meet up. 
658,0:55:04,0:55:06,SPEAKER 2, Any Marcy was it look like this? 
659,0:55:06,0:55:18,SPEAKER 1," I think the big thing, because I think we've loosely talked about going to Australia,  maybe in different places.  But the big change is that Ludwig has recently decided to go.  So we're going to do an episode there.  Yeah. "
660,0:55:18,0:55:20,SPEAKER 2, Which is cool.  Yeah. 
661,0:55:20,0:55:50,SPEAKER 3," So, you know, Chad from anything for, sorry, Chad from Cold Ones.  Yeah.  He's followed me for a while.  And I think it's like adjacent to you.  I've never spoken to him.  I don't know him.  And I followed him since I was in high school.  And I met, I DMed him, because we're going to Australia.  I was just like, where do you guys live?  It'd be cool to like meet up and do something.  And he's like, when do you get here?  I told him the date.  He's like, I'm in New Zealand, but I'll fly home early.  My wife's going to be mad.  And I'm like, I'm like, okay, hold on.  I don't know you yet.  I'm like, yes, I'll go hang out with you. "
662,0:55:50,0:55:51,SPEAKER 4, My wife is going to be pissed. 
663,0:55:51,0:55:52,SPEAKER 1," I'm like, you don't have to do that. "
664,0:55:52,0:55:54,SPEAKER 3, Enjoy the trip with your wife.  I'm not. 
665,0:55:54,0:55:55,SPEAKER 4, That sounds lovely. 
666,0:55:55,0:56:00,SPEAKER 3," You do not.  And he's like, we'll figure it out.  She's going to be so pissed.  I'm like, stop doing this. "
667,0:56:00,0:56:04,SPEAKER 1, Stop doing this.  I won't meet with you.  I won't meet with you. 
668,0:56:04,0:56:05,SPEAKER 3, I won't meet with you. 
669,0:56:05,0:56:07,SPEAKER 1, I won't.  I'll come back. 
670,0:56:07,0:56:08,SPEAKER 4, You know what? 
671,0:56:08,0:56:09,SPEAKER 1, I can kill her. 
672,0:56:09,0:56:11,SPEAKER 4," If I just cut her head off, then she won't be mad. "
673,0:56:11,0:56:12,SPEAKER 1, I'll kill my wife. 
674,0:56:12,0:56:13,SPEAKER 3, I'll kill my damn wife. 
675,0:56:13,0:56:15,SPEAKER 2, He just sends you a screenshot.  Book the flight. 
676,0:56:18,0:56:19,SPEAKER 1, That might happen. 
677,0:56:19,0:56:20,SPEAKER 4, I don't know. 
678,0:56:20,0:56:21,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, that's cool. "
679,0:56:21,0:56:22,SPEAKER 3, Have a cool crossover. 
680,0:56:22,0:56:27,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, we'll be there.  It'll be nice.  We're going to fucking shake down some fucking ruse. "
681,0:56:27,0:56:34,SPEAKER 1," You know, who else is an Australian apparently?  That would be weird to meet.  I feel like is how too basic.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  He lives in Australia. "
682,0:56:34,0:56:36,SPEAKER 3, The reporter of old ones. 
683,0:56:36,0:56:37,SPEAKER 4, Mashing food. 
684,0:56:37,0:56:40,SPEAKER 2," Certainly, he's not open to just meeting people he doesn't know. "
685,0:56:40,0:56:43,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, and his whole thing and not an amendment.  Yeah. "
686,0:56:43,0:56:44,SPEAKER 3, I heard that's not the case. 
687,0:56:44,0:56:47,SPEAKER 1, Anemone.  It's like there's fish in it. 
688,0:56:47,0:56:49,SPEAKER 2," No, I get it's the Nemo reference. "
689,0:56:49,0:56:51,SPEAKER 1," Yeah.  No, what? "
690,0:56:51,0:56:55,SPEAKER 4, Did you ever...  Did you ever get bricked up to that movie? 
691,0:56:55,0:56:57,SPEAKER 3, To finding Nemo? 
692,0:56:57,0:56:59,SPEAKER 1," Yeah.  Yeah, I like to... "
693,0:56:59,0:57:02,SPEAKER 3, There are like two humans in that movie.  What is a child? 
694,0:57:02,0:57:03,SPEAKER 4, That wasn't the question. 
695,0:57:03,0:57:05,SPEAKER 3," Okay, so you're saying to the fish. "
696,0:57:05,0:57:07,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, obviously the fish.  You fucking freak them. "
697,0:57:07,0:57:08,SPEAKER 1, Which fish? 
698,0:57:08,0:57:10,SPEAKER 2," Well, or the boatman. "
699,0:57:10,0:57:12,SPEAKER 4, The boatman?  Aren't they like just the legs? 
700,0:57:12,0:57:13,SPEAKER 1, The kids. 
701,0:57:13,0:57:14,SPEAKER 2, The boy and the chicks. 
702,0:57:14,0:57:15,SPEAKER 1, The boy and the chicks. 
703,0:57:15,0:57:17,SPEAKER 4, The couple of bears on the ocean? 
704,0:57:17,0:57:20,SPEAKER 3," Them seagulls saying, my, my, and I'm getting fucking bricked. "
705,0:57:20,0:57:23,SPEAKER 4," I, what about the turtle who is a cool surfer dude? "
706,0:57:23,0:57:24,SPEAKER 3, Dude. 
707,0:57:24,0:57:25,SPEAKER 1, Noggin. 
708,0:57:25,0:57:27,SPEAKER 4," Surfer dad?  No, we're not Noggin. "
709,0:57:27,0:57:28,SPEAKER 1, Brush. 
710,0:57:28,0:57:29,SPEAKER 4," No, not the baby turtle. "
711,0:57:29,0:57:31,SPEAKER 1, You fucking freak.  They say no matter what you do. 
712,0:57:31,0:57:32,SPEAKER 3, That's the voice line. 
713,0:57:32,0:57:36,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, but you're talking about the baby turtle.  You're talking about dickin' him down.  What? "
714,0:57:36,0:57:38,SPEAKER 1," No, he's talking about dickin' down in the big turtle. "
715,0:57:38,0:57:39,SPEAKER 4, I am talking about dickin' him. 
716,0:57:39,0:57:43,SPEAKER 1, I'm floating in the movie to be clear.  What's floating in the movie?  No one's gonna be quoted. 
717,0:57:43,0:57:44,SPEAKER 4, No one's gonna be quoted. 
718,0:57:44,0:57:45,SPEAKER 2, No one's gonna be quoted. 
719,0:57:45,0:57:46,SPEAKER 1, No one's gonna be quoted. 
720,0:57:46,0:57:49,SPEAKER 2," And being erect at it, which no one is onboard with. "
721,0:57:49,0:57:51,SPEAKER 4," Oh, really.  Zipper. "
722,0:57:51,0:57:52,SPEAKER 1, We're going there. 
723,0:57:52,0:57:53,SPEAKER 3, What is Zipper gonna do for you? 
724,0:57:53,0:57:56,SPEAKER 1, What?  Zipper gonna help you here.  Look at that winning smile. 
725,0:57:56,0:58:00,SPEAKER 4, You know what he's about?  You know what the fuck he's done?  He's thumbing down if anything. 
726,0:58:00,0:58:05,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, I think Australia will be tight though.  It's gonna be three days. "
727,0:58:05,0:58:06,SPEAKER 1, What? 
728,0:58:06,0:58:07,SPEAKER 2, What? 
729,0:58:07,0:58:09,SPEAKER 1, You were hanging on it three months ago? 
730,0:58:09,0:58:11,SPEAKER 3," I, well, yeah, that's the annoying part. "
731,0:58:11,0:58:23,SPEAKER 4," things aligned. No, there's just streamers there now. So you're excited. Oh, man, I thought what it is, bro. Oh, that's okay. Well, I'm gonna get mad anymore. I just accept that. I'm gonna do cold ones. "
732,0:58:23,0:58:30,SPEAKER 2, And then I'm gonna hang out with trash-taste guys. And then I'm gonna stream phantom. And then we're gonna do pods. So those four things. 
733,0:58:31,0:58:36,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, but it was only when it was only a second to you. You were like Australia's boring. Who wants to go there? "
734,0:58:36,0:58:49,SPEAKER 4," Not a good pod episode. Also cringe. I think that's what I mean. That's my very specific beef is that you're like, Australia's gonna be cool. And at three months ago, you're like, Australia seems kind of boring. Yeah, but now I'm excited about it. Yeah. "
735,0:58:50,0:59:00,SPEAKER 1," I'm excited that you're going. I also found out it's winter there. I like it. I was looking at the weather and I was like, damn, I can wear all the clothes. I can't wear here. Well, it's a fucking "
736,0:59:00,0:59:10,SPEAKER 4," 100 degrees all the time. It's only gonna be like 70 something. No, it's it's called in that. No, what the weather app said, like 65. I also think it's cool that if you fly, I think this is so "
737,0:59:10,0:59:19,SPEAKER 2," I don't know why no one else is excited. If you fly from Australia to LA at like noon on a Sunday, you arrive at 9 a.m. on the same Sunday. We get it. "
738,0:59:19,0:59:27,SPEAKER 3," This is like, this is like me and love me. Love me explaining this and me and love me both look at each other into the same thing where it's like, we could never grow up. "
739,0:59:27,0:59:45,SPEAKER 1," We just keep flying and I'm just molding in the office listening to them talking about this. This is like a song tweeting. He's like, oh, it the sun goes down at like 9.30 and and comes up at 4.30 because he's in the UK right now. Yeah, that's "
740,0:59:45,0:59:53,SPEAKER 4," just how latitude works. Okay. Well, to be fair, I was in Vancouver and thought the same thing, but I was just happy about it. Yeah, I wasn't mystified. I just liked it. "
741,0:59:53,1:00:12,SPEAKER 1," Is cool. I would do that. When when people who live in LA have lived in LA or near the equator their entire life, just fucking go to another stage.  Sorry, my daddy doesn't fly a plane. I can go to Singapore. That's a good point. Seven. You have been you've traveled. You grew up in France. You spent half of your life going to France every summer. All say you "
742,1:00:12,1:00:23,SPEAKER 3," went to Saudi Arabia and support their slavery gene. That's true. You have done that supports what? And then it's me, soy jacking and it's eight in with the slaves. And it's the football. "
743,1:00:24,1:00:36,SPEAKER 1," You're telling me so many we get an email and they're like, could we have MBS on the podcast? You guys wouldn't say yes. Martin Bailey Scott, who's MBS, the guy who produced the season two "
744,1:00:36,1:00:45,SPEAKER 3," of the office. He's proud of me. He's the techie too. Oh, I love that guy. If you're watching, we love your shit. Yeah, he made that video about that phone with a big camera. "
745,1:00:45,1:01:11,SPEAKER 4," Oh, it's a big camera. Big camera to be on a phone. I can't believe you slid at some of your own videos. The Sony sensor in there. It's cool. Love that guy. Yeah, get him on you. Yeah, you know, that guy makes great videos. Who is MBS?  Muhammad Bin Salman. Oh, right. Yeah, Muhammad Bin Salman. I was that's what I've been saying. I was thinking about that and I couldn't get there. He's a politician who is a crown prince deputy prime minister, minister of defense. "
746,1:01:11,1:01:23,SPEAKER 1," Sexy. So this is the guy. This is the guy who was like, all right. All right. We will open some movie theaters, but we still get to kill journalists. Okay. Yeah, that's good. "
747,1:01:23,1:01:34,SPEAKER 2," Yeah. I feel like that's a W. How much is it? Is I max? Like, what are we talking? Yeah, like, like what journalists, you know, like, is it a bright bar? Are they French people? "
748,1:01:35,1:01:45,SPEAKER 1," Should we care is what I'm saying? If Michael Babbara put them in the white room, 30 days. Yeah, like you're saying like they sacrifice a journalist instead of they get killed in the action. No, yeah, it's like it's like Dark Souls. "
749,1:01:45,1:02:46,SPEAKER 4," You have to link the journalist flame every the end of every site. Like paper Mario. You just throw one in and it goes, it's spits out a random movie.  It's like, it's like, man, top gun again. It was kind of a shorter journalist from a shitty art magazine. It comes like, well, I'm cheaper by the dozen. Yeah, yeah, you throw in like a hot cool journalist. You get like fucking infinity war.  You throw in and then you get fucking planet earth and you're like, fuck, I want a movie. Planet Earth is really popular. So, yeah, yeah, let's let's circle back to it. As we speak at this very moment, double down, which is a tournament happening in Las Vegas, California is a tournament that is.  in Las Vegas, California, there's double down, it's a tournament, it's a tournament in ultimate and a melee top 12 has been going on today and rivals and take assault one again. That's true. We were watching rivals would be like, man, this is hard to watch.  And then it was like, damn, cake assault did it again. And then we all just. "
750,1:02:47,1:03:00,SPEAKER 1," What character, what character feels that feels the screen was smoke. I can't see anything. That's true. It's hard to see what's going on.  It literally fills the screen with smoke. That's a fighting game. Yeah, I need to watch it. "
751,1:03:00,1:03:06,SPEAKER 2," It's like everything you're playing in your game. Yeah, that is my party before he hits the vape and then he just blows into the screen. "
752,1:03:07,1:03:20,SPEAKER 4," Anyway, I saw Tweet earlier that just said like rip Joe, you were the best and it's like someone's eulogy Twitter post.  And I just thought about sending it to Nick Yingling and be like, not me, bro.  I'm gonna give me, bro. "
753,1:03:20,1:03:23,SPEAKER 2," How much do you pay this guy? Nice try to, Joe. "
754,1:03:23,1:03:38,SPEAKER 4," Alright, so H box is a buff player. You know, you heard of the game. You know what he did.  Everybody know the go. He's fucking shows up. Can you pull up the tweet zipper?  It's like the probably the first one on if it's not already an apology post. You got fucking oppressed. "
755,1:03:38,1:03:53,SPEAKER 1," He got, yeah, the woke mob really took one to the actual thing liberals went too far this time.  This time they might have. Let's see who cancels who somebody had a banger and it was it was H box doing exactly what we all "
756,1:03:53,1:04:20,SPEAKER 4," joked Kyle shields would do that was Kyle Kyle tweeted that thing I did people joke about me doing he's doing.  But yeah, it's the one zipper where he's like it's it's it's his covid test and it's negative.  And he said went to the doctor because he was feeling like shit. I wonder if he deleted it.  And he was like, yeah, he might have coughing up blood. The doctor says it's either covid or it's a bacterial infection my throw.  And then he just immediately says in parentheses, it's not covid. "
757,1:04:20,1:04:25,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, and then it shows it shows the certificate from bench warmers that says I am 12. "
758,1:04:25,1:04:31,SPEAKER 4," Don't worry guys not covid. Yeah, he's a he's what's the business kid and Bojack horsemen. "
759,1:04:31,1:04:42,SPEAKER 1, It's like the three kids in a watch. I think he deleted it. So I sent you on discord zipper. Yeah.  But go ahead him. He's he still showed up and beat S fat and then left. 
760,1:04:42,1:04:50,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, he looked like he was in shadow of the Colossus at the end of the game.  When you're like all the the demons are taking your soul away and you're all haunted. "
761,1:04:50,1:04:54,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, he had martyrdom on. Yeah, he got to get us out with him bro. "
762,1:04:54,1:04:59,SPEAKER 1," He looks like shit. Yeah, I make it. He's like, Oh, this code is really kicking my ass. "
763,1:04:59,1:05:05,SPEAKER 2, He's bleeding from the mouth. He was throwing up like blood and and he went to the doctor not covid. 
764,1:05:05,1:05:11,SPEAKER 1," But then showed up not wearing a mask. Yeah, imagine imagine he's got a mask on and he takes it off after the set. "
765,1:05:11,1:05:18,SPEAKER 2," I just caked it blood inside. Yeah, and I like how the new meta is like the only disease we have to worry about is covid. "
766,1:05:18,1:05:24,SPEAKER 3," No other illnesses can be transferred. Yeah, okay. So here it is. I definitely woke up in the morning and flew up blood. "
767,1:05:24,1:05:47,SPEAKER 4," Flushed emoji. This is not a joke. He literally put the flushed emoji like the blushing guy.  Went to urge you here to say and they said it's covid or bacterial factor my throat slash uvula, which means he has a vagina.  It's not covid. Anyway, I got antibiotics plus steroids via a shot on my butt.  Now I got to play losers. I can mail it. I didn't see this part. It's a covid test.  And then also a picture of him face paulming, but it's kind of like a thumbs up. "
768,1:05:47,1:05:51,SPEAKER 1, I also do want to see what Steve said. Jesus Christ. He's trying to show the wrist. 
769,1:05:51,1:05:54,SPEAKER 2," Steve, the CEO of Team Liquid says do take it easy. "
770,1:05:54,1:06:02,SPEAKER 4," If you don't start feeling better with all those shots and stuff, rest up.  He did not tell him to stop competing because it's time to bring home that fucking bag either way. "
771,1:06:03,1:06:08,SPEAKER 1," Steve is like, look, Juan, you've seen the books and you can't, you need at least two more sets. "
772,1:06:08,1:06:21,SPEAKER 3," H box throws up blood. Same tweet, except it's a spread pick.  That'd be fucking. Yeah, woke up in full of blood, but check out, check out the bands. "
773,1:06:21,1:06:26,SPEAKER 2," Nobody's talking about how he's still be that's bad. Okay, so he beat us back in this in this kind of. "
774,1:06:27,1:07:02,SPEAKER 4," Exactly. Like literally a zombie walk in the earth. He still beats us fat.  One of the best Fox players around. I'm gonna got bio boxed.  And then and then he probably most likely is looking at his phone, seeing people take a dump all over him  for one American wearing a mask because he has Florida DNA and also doing this whole thing  and saying, no, it's not covid. And then he just deacuse himself probably  because it was like insane. And you know, so that's where we're at now.  I thought it'd be fun to try to print it. Yeah, gonna deacuse for safety.  This was after, you know, he looked at Twitter, also escorted myself out of the venue. "
775,1:07:02,1:07:07,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, that's just a fun way of saying I left. Also, my people took me out. "
776,1:07:07,1:07:09,SPEAKER 3, Like my cough to get. 
777,1:07:10,1:07:18,SPEAKER 4," So I thought it'd be fun because we, this is in the thick of it right now.  I think we should try to anticipate what his apology tweet is. "
778,1:07:18,1:07:21,SPEAKER 2," He doesn't make one. No, I think there's nothing more than that. "
779,1:07:22,1:07:26,SPEAKER 3," Sorry, the one who makes mob use the scam.  Demick to push him out of the venue. "
780,1:07:26,1:07:29,SPEAKER 2, They don't want it to grind like fuck you guys straight up. 
781,1:07:29,1:07:32,SPEAKER 1, One one hits the timeline tomorrow up yours more or less. 
782,1:07:32,1:07:37,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, he's gonna tweet. He's gonna be like one.  Demick got me again, flushed emoji. "
783,1:07:37,1:07:40,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, and then it's like a deep fried. He's like a supreme hat. "
784,1:07:40,1:07:46,SPEAKER 1," Do you guys think one shuts down the Gucci store?  Yes, no. "
785,1:07:46,1:07:47,SPEAKER 3, One shuts down the Gucci store. 
786,1:07:47,1:07:56,SPEAKER 4," No, he doesn't shut down the Gucci store.  He does not at all.  Hey guys, hey, we're gonna need you to leave. "
787,1:07:56,1:07:59,SPEAKER 3," Sorry, shut down the Gucci store because he is fucking COVID. "
788,1:07:59,1:08:01,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, he's coming out of the shoes. "
789,1:08:01,1:08:03,SPEAKER 3, Because he's coming in with blood all over his shirt. 
790,1:08:03,1:08:05,SPEAKER 1," He's like, you guys have the cool slip. "
791,1:08:05,1:08:07,SPEAKER 4, How much is this one? 
792,1:08:07,1:08:09,SPEAKER 1, How many female associates? 
793,1:08:12,1:08:14,SPEAKER 3, He's the goat. 
794,1:08:14,1:08:28,SPEAKER 1," I was thinking about what you said, how everybody just worries about COVID.  As if it's the sole sickness that you could get.  Because the most sick I have been in the past five years  was that was the genesis before COVID in the States. "
795,1:08:28,1:08:30,SPEAKER 4," Genesickness, baby. "
796,1:08:30,1:08:31,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, it'll get you. "
797,1:08:31,1:08:37,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, it was like when to the dock, not COVID.  It's in parentheses, just malaria.  Gonna come for one more batch. "
798,1:08:37,1:08:39,SPEAKER 4, I've got consumption. 
799,1:08:39,1:08:42,SPEAKER 2," Anyway, don't make contact with me or it's really normal. "
800,1:08:42,1:08:46,SPEAKER 1, I also brought a jar of mosquitoes that I'm going to open on stage. 
801,1:08:47,1:08:51,SPEAKER 2, West Nile.  These mosquitoes are still on me. 
802,1:08:51,1:09:11,SPEAKER 4," I was thinking about the other day because I took a flight  and I just like wearing a mask.  I always just wear it.  And now it's funny because if you don't wear a mask,  you are considered like a pussy by some people.  But it's like, those people are basically saying,  oh, I like being sick.  Like in general.  It's just to not get sick at all. "
803,1:09:11,1:09:20,SPEAKER 3," We were talking about this.  When you were a mask before COVID,  you were just a person who's careful.  I got events and stuff.  And now your Uber driver is like, what's that for? "
804,1:09:20,1:09:26,SPEAKER 4," It's like, well, do you like being sick?  And they got to be like, well, yeah, I guess. "
805,1:09:26,1:09:28,SPEAKER 3, I think the whole thing is blown out portion. 
806,1:09:28,1:09:44,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, it does suck that it's warped into a statement.  Because when I got super sick in January before COVID,  like I was wearing mask on planes,  because it was like, yeah, I'm very sick right now,  but I need to go somewhere.  I should probably not breathe in people's faces.  Yeah. "
807,1:09:44,1:09:49,SPEAKER 2," I remember we all stole someone's mask.  There was like one person that had a shit ton of masks,  and we all bummed them because we were scared of getting  genosickness. "
808,1:09:49,1:10:00,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, I have a feature that I post every now and then  it's me.  I cut a hole in my mask and I put a cigarette in it.  And I thought that looked funny.  And that was before COVID was a thing. "
809,1:10:00,1:10:03,SPEAKER 1," So that's how COVID was invented.  Yeah, that's good. "
810,1:10:03,1:10:05,SPEAKER 3, That was the two variables that unlocked it. 
811,1:10:05,1:10:12,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, I will tang to my mask and it mixed  with all the cool modern day mad men.  It is, yeah. "
812,1:10:12,1:10:15,SPEAKER 3," Dude, do you see that Joe actually? "
813,1:10:15,1:10:17,SPEAKER 1," No, sir.  No, sir. "
814,1:10:17,1:10:18,SPEAKER 4," No, sir. "
815,1:10:18,1:10:19,SPEAKER 1," No, sir. "
816,1:10:19,1:10:21,SPEAKER 4, What happened in this pudge?  How about you go fuck yourself? 
817,1:10:21,1:10:24,SPEAKER 3, Go from the yard patriot.  He paid for cameos for Josh. 
818,1:10:24,1:10:25,SPEAKER 4, Did you guys watch that? 
819,1:10:25,1:10:27,SPEAKER 3, I didn't see that.  Yeah. 
820,1:10:27,1:10:28,SPEAKER 1, One of them was from Shoonice. 
821,1:10:28,1:10:29,SPEAKER 3, Yeah. 
822,1:10:29,1:10:30,SPEAKER 4, Do you guys know Shoonice? 
823,1:10:30,1:10:31,SPEAKER 1, I was surprised that guy is a lot. 
824,1:10:31,1:10:38,SPEAKER 3," Isn't it crazy, dude?  I was around when Shoonice ate a full toilet paper roll. "
825,1:10:38,1:10:39,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
826,1:10:39,1:10:44,SPEAKER 4, How would you survive that with heart?  Did he eat the core? 
827,1:10:44,1:10:48,SPEAKER 1, He ate the whole lot of seeds and everything. 
828,1:10:48,1:10:50,SPEAKER 2, The heart of the artichoke. 
829,1:10:50,1:10:56,SPEAKER 3," Dude, the video of him slamming the whole bottle  of absolute vodka in 10 seconds is crazy. "
830,1:10:56,1:11:02,SPEAKER 4," Dude, I always like before.  I think it'd be so funny if he does.  I'm sorry. "
831,1:11:02,1:11:20,SPEAKER 1," No, go ahead.  He comes out of all of those videos.  He ends every video.  What a fucked-up porn star looks like at the end of a porn star.  Yeah.  Just streaming down his face.  Just sobbing.  I did it for you.  He's always like, thank you. "
832,1:11:20,1:11:24,SPEAKER 4," You think before he busts down or maybe goes down on somebody, "
833,1:11:24,1:11:28,SPEAKER 1," he's like, you're nice.  Let's go for seven seconds. "
834,1:11:28,1:11:30,SPEAKER 3," Three, two, one. "
835,1:11:30,1:11:33,SPEAKER 4, Shoonice eats your pussy in three seconds. 
836,1:11:33,1:11:34,SPEAKER 1, It's flat. 
837,1:11:34,1:11:49,SPEAKER 3," I've eaten that shit like shoonice.  Dude, this is what...  This is a rapper named since 1999,  who's kind of adjacent to like baby Tron.  And he has a bar where he says eat the beat up like shoonice.  Oh, nice. "
838,1:11:49,1:11:50,SPEAKER 1, That's why he's the goat. 
839,1:11:50,1:11:54,SPEAKER 4, That's hype.  Are you guys gonna replace me? 
840,1:11:54,1:11:55,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
841,1:11:55,1:11:57,SPEAKER 4, With Carl?  You're replaceable. 
842,1:11:57,1:11:58,SPEAKER 2, You're replaceable. 
843,1:11:58,1:12:06,SPEAKER 3," So you want to prove it?  Did you finish the whole episode?  Yeah, I did.  So there was a part where he was like me and his son were talking about  like getting the front yard. "
844,1:12:06,1:12:07,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, the front yard. "
845,1:12:07,1:12:17,SPEAKER 3," We were like, I saw his son completely like a week later at Ludwig's birthday.  And he comes up.  He's like, yeah, so I have an idea for like a podcast called the front yard with me.  You and Carl.  And he brought up independently. "
846,1:12:17,1:12:18,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, yeah. "
847,1:12:18,1:12:19,SPEAKER 3, That was like... 
848,1:12:19,1:12:22,SPEAKER 4," When he brought up the joke too,  because I heard it across the room, I'm like, uh-oh. "
849,1:12:22,1:12:23,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
850,1:12:23,1:12:25,SPEAKER 4, It's happening.  It's really happening. 
851,1:12:25,1:12:26,SPEAKER 2, Here's the thing. 
852,1:12:26,1:12:27,SPEAKER 4," Hey, we're hand-freezed out. "
853,1:12:27,1:12:29,SPEAKER 2, You and me.  Carl doesn't live close enough. 
854,1:12:29,1:12:30,SPEAKER 4, He won't move. 
855,1:12:30,1:12:32,SPEAKER 1," Oh, I'll go.  You'll go. "
856,1:12:32,1:12:34,SPEAKER 2, Yeah.  You would move to North Carolina. 
857,1:12:34,1:12:35,SPEAKER 1, I don't have a nice guy. 
858,1:12:35,1:12:37,SPEAKER 3," I have a bit.  Look, after I saw their setup. "
859,1:12:37,1:12:38,SPEAKER 1," But, dude, he signed me up, brother. "
860,1:12:38,1:12:39,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, he signed me up. "
861,1:12:39,1:12:40,SPEAKER 4, Brother. 
862,1:12:40,1:12:44,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, he signed me up.  And I was just...  I tell you what, not to his there.  I love Katon. "
863,1:12:44,1:12:45,SPEAKER 4, And I've always said that. 
864,1:12:45,1:12:48,SPEAKER 1, I'm like a ton of the rest of my life. 
865,1:12:48,1:12:50,SPEAKER 4, They did have so many versions of Katon. 
866,1:12:50,1:12:54,SPEAKER 3, I will pull out a picture of any CEO he wants up in my bag. 
867,1:12:54,1:12:55,SPEAKER 1, I don't care. 
868,1:12:55,1:13:00,SPEAKER 4," Dude, yeah, I listened the episode and I was like, I was like, fuck, it's funny. "
869,1:13:01,1:13:04,SPEAKER 2," You're just getting, yes, man, I'm all the way down. "
870,1:13:04,1:13:05,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
871,1:13:05,1:13:07,SPEAKER 2," That fair enough, fair enough.  What do you think we do with you? "
872,1:13:07,1:13:08,SPEAKER 4, I'm on the front yard. 
873,1:13:08,1:13:09,SPEAKER 1, I made the cut. 
874,1:13:09,1:13:12,SPEAKER 2," No, man, me to a two-high of a degree, possibly. "
875,1:13:12,1:13:13,SPEAKER 4, Excuse me? 
876,1:13:13,1:13:18,SPEAKER 2," You know, man, me to a two-high of a degree.  That's the last time I know, man, dude.  When you said I was wrong about a looting. "
877,1:13:18,1:13:20,SPEAKER 4," Oh, well, you were. "
878,1:13:20,1:13:21,SPEAKER 2, You were wrong. 
879,1:13:21,1:13:25,SPEAKER 4," No, I don't think I was wrong.  What?  I genuinely think that. "
880,1:13:25,1:13:28,SPEAKER 3, You said a looting is when something didn't happen. 
881,1:13:29,1:13:35,SPEAKER 4," Oh, yeah.  But I still think I used it.  Rivers in the shot in the wrong time.  Rivers in the shot for the rest of the yep.  That's like. "
882,1:13:35,1:13:37,SPEAKER 1, What is on your toe?  What is on your toe? 
883,1:13:37,1:13:38,SPEAKER 4, That rewards other people. 
884,1:13:38,1:13:39,SPEAKER 1, That's gross. 
885,1:13:39,1:13:45,SPEAKER 3," Oh, shit.  My grippers got, my grippers got the fur involved.  I wanted it.  I wanted it. "
886,1:13:45,1:13:46,SPEAKER 4, Grippers with the fur. 
887,1:13:46,1:13:49,SPEAKER 3," So I got the, what's going on over there? "
888,1:13:49,1:13:50,SPEAKER 1, Where are you? 
889,1:13:50,1:13:51,SPEAKER 4, What the fuck is going on? 
890,1:13:51,1:13:52,SPEAKER 1, What? 
891,1:13:52,1:13:55,SPEAKER 2, What was that?  I don't know.  It's something on my toe. 
892,1:13:55,1:14:08,SPEAKER 4, I just got it out.  They're okay.  An audio.  There was a piece of debris on Ludwig's toe that flicked almost over into his mouth.  And I don't know what it was.  It was like a black peppercorn or something.  It was very weird. 
893,1:14:08,1:14:09,SPEAKER 2, It was a tape. 
894,1:14:09,1:14:11,SPEAKER 4, It was a tape on your feet.  Yeah. 
895,1:14:11,1:14:16,SPEAKER 2, This is why we're replacing it by the way.  Why?  For your three minute segments on pieces of tape. 
896,1:14:16,1:14:18,SPEAKER 1, What the fuck did I do?  I was funny. 
897,1:14:18,1:14:42,SPEAKER 3," You're funny.  This is fine.  So I'm wearing the Berks A.K.D., the lesbian threes, whatever you want to call them.  And before I bought these, I reached out to Phil.  Phil, who styled Ludwig for Muggle Money Live, part of stylus designer friend we have.  And I said, I want to buy these.  Do you like them?  And then Phil comes back to me and sends me the Rick Owens versions that the collaboration  of Rick Owens and Berkins stocks that are much more expensive. "
898,1:14:42,1:14:44,SPEAKER 4, He's the only designer I know about. 
899,1:14:44,1:15:04,SPEAKER 3," And I was like, those are really expensive.  And they look better, but they're not as different where I'm like, these are already kind  of expensive.  I'm just thinking about the cheaper ones.  And I bought the cheaper ones.  And I was happy with my purchase.  And I wore them.  And I went down to the local coffee shop where we always had to go and hang out.  And right when I walk in the barista that you ever want the coffee shop where you go  to, they all dressed fucking cool. "
900,1:15:04,1:15:05,SPEAKER 1," And I was like, what's up with that? "
901,1:15:05,1:15:06,SPEAKER 3, It's fucked up. 
902,1:15:06,1:15:07,SPEAKER 4," Like, how do I afford that shit? "
903,1:15:07,1:15:08,SPEAKER 1," It's like, this isn't hot. "
904,1:15:08,1:15:10,SPEAKER 3, Are you hot in here?  Fucking work. 
905,1:15:10,1:15:11,SPEAKER 4, Don't make the work around.

968,1:18:22,1:18:24,SPEAKER 2, To get a business class flight. 
969,1:18:24,1:18:37,SPEAKER 3," To get a business class flight on a,  our Australian flight in a,  and I haven't bid.  And Aiden has bid.  And I say to Aiden, I go, what do you bid?  And he goes, I'm not fucking telling you  because he thinks I'm gonna out bid him.  And try to get it. "
970,1:18:37,1:18:41,SPEAKER 4," Oh, that's fucked up.  This is also corporate fun.  So you need to disclose this to me. "
971,1:18:43,1:18:46,SPEAKER 3," So, so he's like, oh, I forgot about that. "

975,1:18:50,1:18:56,SPEAKER 3," So anyway, so Aiden wouldn't tell me how much he bids.  So I get salty, so I go bid. "
976,1:18:56,1:18:57,SPEAKER 4, And I don't pronounce it. 
977,1:18:57,1:19:03,SPEAKER 3," And I don't tell Aiden what I bid.  Okay.  And Aiden, after I bid has the fucking, "

985,1:19:14,1:19:15,SPEAKER 3," No, it's not locked. "
986,1:19:15,1:19:17,SPEAKER 2, Did you know you could open it again?

1039,1:21:06,1:21:07,SPEAKER 2, No. 
1040,1:21:07,1:21:11,SPEAKER 1," Okay.  No, no, no, no, no.  What do I mean?  Well, he's talking about that. "

1044,1:21:29,1:21:31,SPEAKER 2," This is so much.  I'm also going to Vegas, one night, always. "
1045,1:21:31,1:21:32,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
1046,1:21:32,1:21:35,SPEAKER 3," And I'm going to Vegas maybe, and you're being incredibly, really strong. "
1047,1:21:35,1:21:37,SPEAKER 1," Baby, don't get on.  I'm not scared to go. "
1048,1:21:37,1:21:46,SPEAKER 2," And he goes, and he goes.  Some my mom's in Vegas this weekend.  And I'm like, I'm like, oh.  Oh, and he's like, maybe you two link up. "
1049,1:21:46,1:21:49,SPEAKER 1," What?  That was like, what? "
1050,1:21:49,1:22:04,SPEAKER 2," And he's like, well, yeah, my dad bailed,  so she's all alone.  And I was like, what are you talking about?  And he's like, she's looking for a good time. "
1051,1:22:04,1:22:06,SPEAKER 4, She's looking for a stud. 
1052,1:22:06,1:22:10,SPEAKER 1," Oh, this is exaggerated.  Is that true? "
1053,1:22:10,1:22:14,SPEAKER 4," Is your beautiful, lovely mother looking  from my mom? "
1054,1:22:14,1:22:16,SPEAKER 2, My mommy needs a big boy now. 
1055,1:22:16,1:22:17,SPEAKER 1, She needs a maverick. 
1056,1:22:17,1:22:18,SPEAKER 2, She needs a maverick. 
1057,1:22:18,1:23:15,SPEAKER 1," No, this is what happened, this is what happened.  My mom and dad were going to Vegas this week, kid.  And I was going to go meet them originally,  but I could not, because this week just got too busy.  But for the first part, my mom got there first for a day  without my dad, because he had something to do for work.  So he was going to get there a day late.  And my mom, when she was telling me about this trip,  I told her, I was like, oh, that's cool, like Ludwig  and some of our other friends from around the country  are going to be in Vegas for like this Mr. Beast event.  And she's like, oh, I finally get to meet Doublelift,  which was weird, because I don't usually bring him up.  And she kept asking where you were doing the event.  Because I think she had this idea  that she could check out what you were doing that weekend. "
1058,1:23:15,1:23:16,SPEAKER 3, Like it was in Oakland stop by. 
1059,1:23:16,1:23:28,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, like a booth and I think I told her,  I was like, yeah, it's in like the luxur.  And that's weird because we were sitting in the, come on. "
1060,1:23:28,1:23:29,SPEAKER 4," Oh, of course. "
1061,1:23:29,1:23:36,SPEAKER 1," We were sitting in the office.  We were sitting in the office.  And I was just like, my mom, that's how I brought it up.  Like my mom was in Vegas this weekend. "
1062,1:23:36,1:23:45,SPEAKER 2, But he said in a way that the whole thing out with anybody.  Like I couldn't link up with her after that.  Unless I was going to go fuck his mom.  Because he said it in such a sexually suggestive way. 
1063,1:23:45,1:23:47,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.  Because I thought it'd be fun. 
1064,1:23:47,1:23:49,SPEAKER 4," See, this is what I knew it was out on by not being in the house. "
1065,1:23:49,1:23:50,SPEAKER 3, And you were late to the flight? 
1066,1:23:50,1:23:52,SPEAKER 2, Yeah.  Yeah. 
1067,1:23:52,1:23:58,SPEAKER 1," It was a, oh.  Is that, is that what gambling with Mr. Beast meets?  Fucking. "
1068,1:23:58,1:23:59,SPEAKER 3, Yeah. 
1069,1:23:59,1:24:00,SPEAKER 1," Oh, I was going to Beast mode. "
1070,1:24:00,1:24:03,SPEAKER 2, No.  I had my mom fuck one of my friends. 
1071,1:24:03,1:24:05,SPEAKER 4," Anyway, he calls his dick Mr. Beast. "
1072,1:24:05,1:24:15,SPEAKER 1," My dad was there yesterday, right?  While you're still in Vegas.  And my dad is texting me.  But there's little like typo errors and stuff.  So I think my dad was drunk texting me. "
1073,1:24:15,1:24:16,SPEAKER 2," No, that was me using his phone. "
1074,1:24:16,1:24:17,SPEAKER 1, Which one? 
1075,1:24:17,1:24:18,SPEAKER 4, I'll come on. 
1076,1:24:18,1:24:19,SPEAKER 2," See, I'm both. "
1077,1:24:19,1:24:20,SPEAKER 1, I'm not getting it. 
1078,1:24:20,1:24:22,SPEAKER 3," Let's just say the longer they keep their hands on,  they went $1,000. "
1079,1:24:22,1:24:24,SPEAKER 1, I'm not getting it. 
1080,1:24:24,1:24:27,SPEAKER 2," Sorry, I took their hands off of my mom.  I guess they're very hurt. "
1081,1:24:27,1:24:38,SPEAKER 1," Come on.  My, my, my parents don't drink very much.  It's funny to get a drunk text from my dad  because like it just never happens. "
1082,1:24:38,1:24:40,SPEAKER 3, I think about curving it sometimes. 
1083,1:24:40,1:24:42,SPEAKER 2, I'm in the sky right now. 
1084,1:24:42,1:24:45,SPEAKER 1, I've thought about turning it once or twice. 
1085,1:24:45,1:24:47,SPEAKER 2, I hope the autopilot don't fail. 
1086,1:24:47,1:24:48,SPEAKER 1," Hey, I'm sorry. "
1087,1:24:48,1:24:49,SPEAKER 4, I'm a cherry vodka down the fly. 
1088,1:24:49,1:24:51,SPEAKER 3, I'm really sorry about those texts last night.  I would never turn a blind. 
1089,1:24:51,1:24:54,SPEAKER 1," He's like, he's actually me a lot.  He's like asking what I'm up to right now. "
1090,1:24:54,1:24:55,SPEAKER 3, Have you seen your mother? 
1091,1:24:55,1:25:13,SPEAKER 1," He's like a nice thing.  He's like, he's like, I wish, we wish you were here.  Like that's, that's like a nice sentiment, right?  And I'm still, we're still doing the postcards.  Like an hour passes.  And it's like, I think it's almost midnight.  And my dad texts me again.  And he just sends me what's Ludwig's number? "
1092,1:25:15,1:25:16,SPEAKER 4, That's really funny. 
1093,1:25:16,1:25:22,SPEAKER 1, Which is really funny because I think my dad  wants his number so that he can call you  to see if my mom and dad can meet up with you that. 
1094,1:25:22,1:25:24,SPEAKER 2," Well, she can meet up with you. "
1095,1:25:24,1:25:33,SPEAKER 1," Yeah.  And I'm just, I just make, I, I just call an audible.  I'm like, dad, he's at like a poker event right now.  I know you can't, I don't even need to call her. "
1096,1:25:33,1:25:34,SPEAKER 3, You're a coward. 
1097,1:25:34,1:25:37,SPEAKER 4, You took it all sweet in the house.  You were on the stream. 
1098,1:25:37,1:25:40,SPEAKER 1, You were on the stream.  I didn't want to give you five minutes. 
1099,1:25:40,1:25:41,SPEAKER 3," Well, he did dip out from poker. "
1100,1:25:41,1:25:43,SPEAKER 1, I've he did that way early. 
1101,1:25:43,1:25:44,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, I played one hand. "
1102,1:25:44,1:25:47,SPEAKER 1," We turned on God, he turned off the broadcast.  We didn't know that. "
1103,1:25:47,1:25:49,SPEAKER 2," No, no, I, you did not turn it off before I left. "
1104,1:25:49,1:25:51,SPEAKER 3," No, remember we kept saying we're loving it. "
1105,1:25:51,1:25:59,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, because I thought I'm re-bought.  You say something about buying in for 15K.  And then I thought you were hunting 15K.  And I thought you were coming back to the stream. "
1106,1:25:59,1:26:03,SPEAKER 2, I played one 5K hand because I didn't want to be  disrespectful.  So that's a left. 
1107,1:26:03,1:26:05,SPEAKER 3, He was setting up rose petals in the Bellagio suite. 
1108,1:26:05,1:26:06,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
1109,1:26:06,1:26:09,SPEAKER 2, I wish I hung out with your mom and dad. 
1110,1:26:09,1:26:14,SPEAKER 4," That would, honestly, that'd be fucking fun.  Imagine I run up a couple grand with agents parents. "
1111,1:26:14,1:26:17,SPEAKER 1, I actually do think my parents are fun people  to hang out with.  Let me see. 
1112,1:26:17,1:26:18,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, they are. "
1113,1:26:18,1:26:21,SPEAKER 1, Not in that way.  They are.  They are saying it like this. 
1114,1:26:21,1:26:22,SPEAKER 2, I just said they're fun to hang out with. 
1115,1:26:22,1:26:23,SPEAKER 1, I don't like this. 
1116,1:26:23,1:26:26,SPEAKER 4, What happened?  Why are you mad?  He just said they're fun to hang out with. 
1117,1:26:26,1:26:27,SPEAKER 3, I just said they're fun to hang out with. 
1118,1:26:27,1:26:29,SPEAKER 1," I'm sure you're dad's right, too. "
1119,1:26:29,1:26:36,SPEAKER 4," Listen, I would do, I would do, listen to me.  I would do anything for her.  That's all. "
1120,1:26:36,1:26:37,SPEAKER 3, I want to tell you. 
1121,1:26:37,1:26:39,SPEAKER 4, I would do anything for her. 
1122,1:26:39,1:26:40,SPEAKER 2, I would do anything for her. 
1123,1:26:40,1:26:42,SPEAKER 4, Unthinkable things.  Okay. 
1124,1:26:42,1:26:43,SPEAKER 2, So just know that. 
1125,1:26:43,1:26:44,SPEAKER 4, Unthinkable. 
1126,1:26:44,1:26:45,SPEAKER 3, You know. 
1127,1:26:45,1:26:46,SPEAKER 1, We are all uninvited thanksgiving. 
1128,1:26:46,1:26:47,SPEAKER 3, By the way. 
1129,1:26:47,1:26:49,SPEAKER 2," Can we get your family reunion, by the way? "
1130,1:26:49,1:27:23,SPEAKER 1," The family reunion.  So we were talking to, I'm going to a family reunion the weekend after we get back  from Australia.  And I brought this up when it was me, Ludwig and Yingling in the office.  And Yingling immediately says, yo, can I come?  He's joking.  He just wants to insert himself into any situation.  But I'm like, yes, you can't.  You actually can come if you want to.  You're a lot like, it would be awesome if you came with me to my family reunion.  That would be fucking hilarious.  Yeah.  Immediately backs down.  And he starts asking me to buy his flight.  Like, what? "
1131,1:27:23,1:27:32,SPEAKER 4," I can't handle him.  I yelled at him earlier today.  I said, I cannot be there for a fucking week with you Nick Gingley.  If you're commenting on every roadside you see, I'm going to fucking shoot myself.  I'm not doing it. "
1132,1:27:32,1:27:50,SPEAKER 1," This is it.  We decided this last night because we realized Yingling, Yingling bought his flight to go to Australia.  He's coming on the trip with us, right?  He is not going on the same flight of us as us.  So we're all flying direct.  Yingling has a 12 hour layover in Fiji alone. "
1133,1:27:50,1:27:51,SPEAKER 4, I don't even know where that is. 
1134,1:27:51,1:27:54,SPEAKER 2," He said, on God, as an American, can I go to Fiji? "
1135,1:27:54,1:27:55,SPEAKER 1, You know what? 
1136,1:27:55,1:27:57,SPEAKER 2, You know what?  You're Saudi Arabia. 
1137,1:27:57,1:28:06,SPEAKER 3, You know what?  You don't ironically fucking said to us.  He's in the room.  There's no fucking Vegas sweets in Fiji.  There's only beachside hotels. 
1138,1:28:06,1:28:13,SPEAKER 1, He said they came out of his mouth.  The first time Yingling has left the country was Vancouver like a month ago. 
1139,1:28:13,1:28:16,SPEAKER 3," I'm like, you want the strip there?  What is your point? "
1140,1:28:16,1:28:17,SPEAKER 2, He's my goat. 
1141,1:28:17,1:28:23,SPEAKER 4, No.  I know that guy.  He's going to land and he's just going to have to figure it out.  I don't want to deal with Yingling. 
1142,1:28:23,1:28:32,SPEAKER 1, That's the same soul that's the American tourist soul that has people go to fucking  Disneyland every time instead of going anywhere else. 
1143,1:28:32,1:28:34,SPEAKER 4, You're saying Yingling's true calling is Disneyland? 
1144,1:28:34,1:28:36,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.  I see. 
1145,1:28:36,1:28:38,SPEAKER 2, I see.  Be happy there. 
1146,1:28:38,1:28:46,SPEAKER 1," Yeah.  He would be safer for him.  Anyway, he's going to rent a nice villa in Fiji and take photos alone.  Oh, yeah.  I would fill up with this 10 hour period. "
1147,1:28:46,1:28:56,SPEAKER 3," It's one of the yard would pay for one night in a sweet in Fiji.  If he took 100 photos for a Nick Yingling experience slideshow, then we got to talk about on  the episode next. "
1148,1:28:56,1:28:57,SPEAKER 4, I would love that very much. 
1149,1:28:57,1:28:58,SPEAKER 1, That's a good idea. 
1150,1:28:58,1:29:14,SPEAKER 3," But he also, me and the Yingling last night would Aiden gave up and when Aiden goes to  bail on postcards, me and Yingling were in the fucking trenches, 1 a.m. finishing them all.  We watched a ride through of one of the Super Mario world, like rides that exists mid and  he goes, this is like Disneyland, but Mario. "
1151,1:29:14,1:29:17,SPEAKER 2," He's like a son who goes, I love anime. "
1152,1:29:17,1:29:18,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
1153,1:29:18,1:29:19,SPEAKER 2, I can't fucking. 
1154,1:29:19,1:29:26,SPEAKER 3," I was like, I literally alone in a room with him.  I said, God, dude, what the fuck are you talking about?  It's a fucking amusement park. "
1155,1:29:26,1:29:27,SPEAKER 4, And what did he say to that? 
1156,1:29:27,1:29:29,SPEAKER 3," He just said, didn't say anything. "
1157,1:29:29,1:29:30,SPEAKER 4, You should respond. 
1158,1:29:30,1:29:36,SPEAKER 3," And then he just, when you talk, you should be attending and he pointed at the sky and  the video and said, is that really the sky? "
1159,1:29:36,1:29:37,SPEAKER 4, No. 
1160,1:29:37,1:29:38,SPEAKER 1, Or are they in a room? 
1161,1:29:38,1:29:39,SPEAKER 3," No, I'm dead. "
1162,1:29:39,1:29:40,SPEAKER 1, I'm dead serious. 
1163,1:29:40,1:29:41,SPEAKER 3," He goes, are they in a room? "
1164,1:29:41,1:29:44,SPEAKER 1," And I'm like, how big would the room have to be, Yingling? "
1165,1:29:44,1:29:50,SPEAKER 2," Well, is it today's a lot of Yingling if you don't know.  It's 7-10, which is National Dab Day. "
1166,1:29:50,1:29:51,SPEAKER 1, It's also National Dab Day. 
1167,1:29:51,1:29:53,SPEAKER 4," It's also National Cappy Bar-A-Day, so. "
1168,1:29:53,1:29:54,SPEAKER 2," Well, the dab. "
1169,1:29:54,1:29:55,SPEAKER 4, I should have the dab. 
1170,1:29:55,1:29:56,SPEAKER 2," The dab users are trending on Twitter, so. "
1171,1:29:56,1:29:59,SPEAKER 4," So are the Cappy Boris.  No, don't say that.  No. "
1172,1:29:59,1:30:00,SPEAKER 2," Hey, fuck up. "
1173,1:30:00,1:30:01,SPEAKER 4," Ludwig, don't say that. "
1174,1:30:01,1:30:02,SPEAKER 1, Fuck him. 
1175,1:30:02,1:30:03,SPEAKER 2, Fuck him. 
1176,1:30:03,1:30:04,SPEAKER 1," Oh, fuck him. "
1177,1:30:04,1:30:07,SPEAKER 4," Don't transition into some sort of British accent, Cappy Bar-A-Day. "
1178,1:30:07,1:30:09,SPEAKER 2," You know why it's National Dab Day, by the way? "
1179,1:30:09,1:30:10,SPEAKER 4," 7-10, because- "
1180,1:30:10,1:30:12,SPEAKER 3, Because of the well-solid shadow. 
1181,1:30:12,1:30:17,SPEAKER 2," It's actually really dumb reason.  It's because upside down, it spells out oil. "
1182,1:30:17,1:30:26,SPEAKER 3," So it's dude, that's just a, that's just a idea.  Like some guy was in there and he's like, yeah. "
1183,1:30:26,1:30:32,SPEAKER 4," It's also National The Drums in Donkey Kong Day, because that's what they also say on  them when they're flaming, though. "
1184,1:30:32,1:30:33,SPEAKER 2," Oh, yeah. "
1185,1:30:33,1:31:00,SPEAKER 1," We were talking about this at your birthday, because we were argued about like a Valorant  game that we played when everybody, like it just in the yard, like Fred and server that  we have.  And Yingling was playing with me for a while first, before playing with anybody else.  And we get into the second game, and he's just like, I'm so fucking high right now.  Like, I just keep hitting my dab, and I'm like, dude, just, why don't you stop hitting  the pen?  That sounds like an easy solution through one.  We get into the fourth game. "
1186,1:31:00,1:31:01,SPEAKER 3, I'm not an S. They don't admit that. 
1187,1:31:01,1:31:34,SPEAKER 1," Yingling over the course of like three, four hours is talking less and less and less.  And we're getting it.  We're finally five stacking, and everybody else is talking, except I'm not talking very  much.  And Yingling is not talking at all.  And I realize that Yingling hasn't said anything in almost 20 minutes.  And then all of a sudden pops up in the corner of the chat.  It says, boss baby took one more dab so high right now, and it's transcribing his like  brain in with his boss baby smurf account in the corner, in the discord, unmuted, just  not saying anything. "
1188,1:31:34,1:31:51,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, well, we called them over.  It was at Ludwig's birthday party.  There was a bunch of us.  And I started, like, Yingling started talking about playing Valorant with Aiden that night.  And he was like, and he just fucking, he didn't do anything.  And I'm like, well, let's get him over here.  Aiden, like his Jerry Springer, like, let's bring him down. "
1189,1:31:51,1:31:52,SPEAKER 3, We have Aiden in the studio. 
1190,1:31:52,1:31:56,SPEAKER 1," Aiden.  And he was like, oh, he's got the top frag. "
1191,1:31:56,1:32:09,SPEAKER 4," He's like, hey, what?  And then we started explaining the whole thing.  It's like, you didn't do this.  And he's like, yeah.  And then he's like, yeah, I thought frag.  And then he's like, yeah, he's like, yeah, top frag.  And I'm like, well, Nick, what do you have to say to that?  And he's like, he didn't Molly. "
1192,1:32:09,1:32:11,SPEAKER 1, He's supposed to Molly.  He has a character who has it. 
1193,1:32:11,1:32:21,SPEAKER 4," And then he did.  It was extremely funny.  And that brought me to another, just a little topic, is that all of our friends are  really funny.  And at your birthday party, it was really nice. "
1194,1:32:21,1:32:43,SPEAKER 2," Dude, okay.  So one quick anecdote at the birthday party, there was a bunch of gifts.  And I, like, I've had a few birthday dinners, but I don't usually get that many presents.  And I don't like receiving presents.  Like even before I had any success on YouTube, I hated like Christmas, because I would open  a gift.  And I feel like I am bad at showing that I am grateful for the gift, even if I feel it.  And I end up looking like a robot. "
1195,1:32:43,1:32:44,SPEAKER 1, Isn't it because you weren't? 
1196,1:32:44,1:32:46,SPEAKER 2," No, I am very grateful.  And I think it's very nice. "
1197,1:32:46,1:32:54,SPEAKER 3," But I, like, you and Judy are a hilarious combo because you can't show when you're grateful  and she can only show when she's ungrateful. "
1198,1:32:54,1:32:55,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
1199,1:32:55,1:33:01,SPEAKER 2," So every Christmas, I'd be like, wow, this is great.  But I'm like, you know, I sound like a fucking shitty child actor. "
1200,1:33:01,1:33:02,SPEAKER 4, Yeah. 
1201,1:33:02,1:33:03,SPEAKER 1, Like you got socks on. 
1202,1:33:03,1:33:04,SPEAKER 4, Because you don't want to hurt grandma's feelings. 
1203,1:33:04,1:33:21,SPEAKER 2," Yeah.  But I do like the socks.  Okay.  And so, and I see this mountain of gifts at my birthday, because like 30 people came  over for dinner.  And I'm like, I'm like, okay, well, maybe I don't have to open them in front of them.  And then cutie's like, okay, everybody round up to the living room.  It's gift opening time.  And I pull her side.  I'm like, no. "
1204,1:33:21,1:33:25,SPEAKER 4," I saw this on the roof.  Yeah.  I heard Ludwig be like, I don't want to do that. "
1205,1:33:25,1:33:27,SPEAKER 2, I'm going to kill myself.  I'm not going to sit there. 
1206,1:33:27,1:33:37,SPEAKER 3," It's hilarious because she's like for your birthday.  I got you a YouTube video.  And that must have been after that conversation.  Yeah.  Because I was like, because hearing now that you were like, your gift you got me for my  birthday is going to be killed myself. "
1207,1:33:37,1:33:38,SPEAKER 1, It's really funny. 
1208,1:33:38,1:33:46,SPEAKER 2," I was like, I hated it before.  But now it's even worse because now I'm like, Dudley, who has like a thousand presence and  you're watching like the millionaire open up his gifts. "
1209,1:33:46,1:33:48,SPEAKER 1, I also wish that he's seven this year. 
1210,1:33:48,1:33:54,SPEAKER 3, I also wish she would have told us that the gifts were going to go in a video.  Wow. 
1211,1:33:54,1:33:59,SPEAKER 1," I'm going to go out into a different building.  Both of you.  You know, mine's fine. "
1212,1:33:59,1:34:01,SPEAKER 4, Mine was a question mark. 
1213,1:34:01,1:34:24,SPEAKER 2," I don't know if it can, but the basic premise is that everybody got me a shirt that was like  a funny shirt.  Sound a lot of funny shirts.  And I would open them and I would show them and everyone would laugh and I would guess  who got me the shirt.  And there are some shirts that clearly people didn't know YouTube videos in mine because  it'd be like, woo-hon flew and then a bat. "
1214,1:34:24,1:34:25,SPEAKER 1, Okay. 
1215,1:34:25,1:34:29,SPEAKER 3, I'll show it on.  In defense of whoever got you that one. 
1216,1:34:29,1:34:31,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.  Because it ain't me. 
1217,1:34:31,1:34:32,SPEAKER 4, Yeah. 
1218,1:34:32,1:34:37,SPEAKER 3," Whoever it was.  It said woo-hon wild wings, dangerously contagious. "
1219,1:34:37,1:34:38,SPEAKER 2, Yeah. 
1220,1:34:38,1:34:40,SPEAKER 3, Or so sorry.  So good. 
1221,1:34:40,1:34:46,SPEAKER 2," And there was like one and it was like, it was the Hooters logo and it said 9-11 and  there was twin towers. "
1222,1:34:46,1:34:47,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
1223,1:34:47,1:34:55,SPEAKER 4," It was cuties.  And it said Hooters never forget.  No, it said something even funnier.  It was like a play on it.  It's like, wing will never forget or something like that. "
1224,1:34:55,1:35:01,SPEAKER 2," They're crazy shirts.  My favorite one was probably the one zipper got me, which I wore at the BearioCard event,  which was coo-smoking weed. "
1225,1:35:01,1:35:03,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.  Do that shirt was so tight. 
1226,1:35:03,1:35:04,SPEAKER 4, Yeah. 
1227,1:35:04,1:35:06,SPEAKER 3," That was very, very weird.  But like wore it the next day too. "
1228,1:35:06,1:35:17,SPEAKER 2," Yeah.  And the one was the Native American man and it's just a solid, a Native American man  just staring into the camera and it said, trust the government. "
1229,1:35:17,1:35:20,SPEAKER 1," Yeah.  It was, it was a crazy shirt. "
1230,1:35:20,1:35:22,SPEAKER 3, That is such a fucking insane shirt. 
1231,1:35:22,1:35:24,SPEAKER 2, And I don't know what it stands for. 
1232,1:35:24,1:35:25,SPEAKER 1, I don't know either. 
1233,1:35:25,1:35:29,SPEAKER 3," Let me just say, every shirt that came out of this night was thrifted except for the "
1234,1:35:29,1:35:31,SPEAKER 4," cute one.  No, no, no. "
1235,1:35:31,1:35:32,SPEAKER 1," A lot of them were, like, made. "
1236,1:35:32,1:35:33,SPEAKER 2," Most of them were more thrifted, most of them were thrifted. "
1237,1:35:33,1:35:34,SPEAKER 4," No, no. "
1238,1:35:34,1:35:35,SPEAKER 1, The only one was Coots. 
1239,1:35:35,1:35:39,SPEAKER 2," And the one's the, and the Atriak one, which was like, I have pretty much described it,  painted ones too. "
1240,1:35:39,1:35:40,SPEAKER 3, Oh. 
1241,1:35:40,1:35:41,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
1242,1:35:41,1:35:42,SPEAKER 2," And then the, the hair paint. "
1243,1:35:42,1:35:43,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
1244,1:35:43,1:35:46,SPEAKER 4, Most of them were thrifted.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
1245,1:35:46,1:35:51,SPEAKER 3, That Native American one was thrifted and whoever saw it.  But the reason mine was so insane was it came out of a thrift store.  I found that. 
1246,1:35:51,1:35:55,SPEAKER 1," Oh, did he?  I would never make that.  Like, you mean it.  No. "
1247,1:35:55,1:35:56,SPEAKER 4," No, I don't. "
1248,1:35:56,1:35:57,SPEAKER 3, Oh my god. 
1249,1:35:57,1:35:58,SPEAKER 1, It's so much better. 
1250,1:35:58,1:36:01,SPEAKER 3, It's a triple XL racist t-shirt that is parodying Buffalo Wild Wings.  Yeah. 
1251,1:36:01,1:36:04,SPEAKER 1," And I was like, dude, I have to take this.  Yeah. "
1252,1:36:04,1:36:10,SPEAKER 4," Why?  Well, the Native American one I saw at Goodwill, I was like, what does this mean?  Yeah. "
1253,1:36:10,1:36:11,SPEAKER 1," And I was like, well, this is a puzzle. "
1254,1:36:11,1:36:13,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, exactly.  I was like, exactly. "
1255,1:36:13,1:36:14,SPEAKER 1, Yeah. 
1256,1:36:14,1:36:17,SPEAKER 2, And then the only one that was made was the songs that said 9-11 was poggers. 
1257,1:36:17,1:36:30,SPEAKER 3," The one, the one I didn't give you that I thought about giving you that I kept was it's  a shirt that has the Fendi logo around the whole neckline.  But then the shirt itself is all over a repeat print of the McDonald's logo. "
1258,1:36:30,1:36:31,SPEAKER 2, Yeah. 
1259,1:36:31,1:36:49,SPEAKER 3," Instead of saying McDonald's, it says McDonald's.  And I asked the guy at the register, I said, dude, where did this Fendi McDonald's shirt  come from?  And without even looking at it, he goes, it's McDonald's.  And I looked down and read closer, and it's just like a, he's like, yeah, he's just like  come out of Taiwan. "
1260,1:36:49,1:36:51,SPEAKER 4," He's like, yeah, that'll be $6. "
1261,1:36:51,1:36:55,SPEAKER 3," They literally just spawned from Taiwan, and we don't know how they exist. "
1262,1:36:55,1:37:02,SPEAKER 2," I'll just imagine it's one due to the factory, it just changes the file print, and then  that day they just have Fendi McDonald's, and they're like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, "
1263,1:37:02,1:37:03,SPEAKER 4," ship 20,000. "
1264,1:37:03,1:37:09,SPEAKER 3," It'll sell hard.  The one that's dipped to you got you, which is Johnny Bravo, and it says Johnny likes on "
1265,1:37:09,1:37:11,SPEAKER 1," it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. "
1266,1:37:11,1:37:15,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, they were tight.  So I've, I kind of want to do a photo shoot with all of them. "
1267,1:37:15,1:37:17,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.  That'd be great. 
1268,1:37:17,1:37:19,SPEAKER 2," Yeah.  Anyway, that's, that's it, fellas. "
1269,1:37:19,1:37:21,SPEAKER 3," Well done, 90.  We got to get to the airport. "
1270,1:37:21,1:37:24,SPEAKER 2," Yeah.  You guys got a dip in dots going Australia, you lose two days. "
1271,1:37:24,1:37:27,SPEAKER 4," Have fun.  Because you were so late, I have a punishment for you. "
1272,1:37:27,1:37:28,SPEAKER 2," Okay, daddy. "
1273,1:37:28,1:37:29,SPEAKER 3, Don't fart. 
1274,1:37:29,1:37:30,SPEAKER 1, I'll try. 
1275,1:37:30,1:37:31,SPEAKER 3," No, dude. "
1276,1:37:31,1:37:48,SPEAKER 1," No, they smell bad today.  Get out of here quick.  Okay, we're going to do the premium in Australia.  Bye, everyone.  Bye, everyone.  And he turns around.  He looks at me.  Everybody.  There's so many people around us.  They're all putting their bags away.  They're very well with an earshot, because he's not speaking quietly, either.  He's like, hey, you look good.  Yeah.  You look hot.  You look hot. "
1277,1:37:48,1:37:54,SPEAKER 3," It turns to me and he goes, I just met this guy on the plane. "
1278,1:37:54,1:38:03,SPEAKER 1, Super hot.  And that was it.  And that was the only thing I saw somebody laugh at.  It's a lady next to Nick laughed at that.  To them. 
1279,1:38:03,1:38:03,SPEAKER 4," To them, it's like I'm just picking someone up. "
